Jennifer Lopez hosted the 2015 American Music Awards and performed a medley of popular songs at the time, including Minaj's salacious "Anaconda" track. When Lopez was performing that song the camera panned over Minaj who had an unimpressed look on her face, per <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>Social media users noticed the "Feeling Myself" rapper's unenthused face and took it as shade toward Lopez. "Damn J Lo ... Nicki Minaj facial expression says it all" DJ Akademiks tweeted at the time (via ET). Minaj was quick to explain why she made that face while Lopez performed. "I'm looking at my own face on the screen when I'm looking to the right. I turn Bak & look @ her," she <a href=#>tweeted</a> to Akademiks. Perhaps Minaj's facial reaction was blown out of proportion, but there were other reasons that hinted at a feud between the rapper and "On the Floor" singer.</p><p dir=ltr>In 2014, Minaj recruited Casper Smart to be the choreographer for her tour, as he also choreographed her "Anaconda" music video, per <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>. The dancer was best-known to the public as Lopez's ex-boyfriend. The following year, in 2015 — before Lopez hosted the AMAs — paparazzi spotted Minaj hanging out with Smart. Reportedly, the "Hustlers" star was not thrilled to see her ex hanging out with Minaj, per <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>. Years later, a Minaj rap verse had fans speculating the grudge was back on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcnBibIF3e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2jtqS3yGakoqaRn3qiusNmoZ6mnp6zpr6MpaapnaqoerPBzKipnpxdl7Kmso4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./us-presidents-facts.html><span>←</span><span>The Most Fascinating Fact About Every Single U.S. President</span></a>
