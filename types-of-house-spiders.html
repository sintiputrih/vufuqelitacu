Said to eat her mate after their “romantic business” is complete, this rather violent dating ritual happens in nature less than we might think.</p><p><strong>What they look like: </strong>The female black widow (3/8-in.) is identifiable by its pearly-black body and orange-to-red hourglass-shaped marking on the underside of the abdomen. The much slighter and harmless male is nearly half the size of a female, with faint red or white spots on the abdomen.</p><p><strong>Where to find them:</strong> Though found worldwide, five species are most common in the Southern and Western United States. They spin sticky, irregular webs typically located near the ground. They prefer dry, warm places like wood piles, abandoned rodent burrows, under decks and in barrels, basements and crawl spaces.</p><p><strong>What to do if you see one: </strong>Steer clear. Although not particularly aggressive, a female black widow’s neurotoxin venom is said to be 15 times stronger than a rattlesnake’s. Though rarely fatal, a bite can be extremely painful and cause muscle aches, nausea and breathing difficulties. Seek medical attention immediately.</p><p><strong>How to prevent them: </strong>To control black widows and other bugs around your home, remove clutter and debris, keep the grass trimmed and install screens and door sweeps. To repel them, mix a DIY solution of essential oil (lemon, tea tree, eucalyptus, tea tree or peppermint), water and a drop of dish soap into a spray bottle and mist around the perimeter of your home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.familyhandyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1089189902.jpg> <span class=credits-overlay><span class="image-credit noskim">PeteMuller/Getty Images</span></span><h2>Brown Recluse Spiders</h2><p>Another poisonous species, <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/article/brown-recluse-spiders/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">the brown recluse spider</a>, as its name suggests, likes living the quiet life away from where the action is.</p><p><strong>What they look like: </strong>This web-spinning arachnid presents with markings on the head shaped like a violin. Beside the distinctive markings and light-brown color, you can spot it by its six eyes; most spiders have eight. Their body size ranges between 1/4- to 1/2-in. long.</p><p><strong>Where to find them: </strong>Native to the Midwest and Southern U.S., the recluse enjoys sheltering underneath dry logs, rocks and piles of leaves. They’re capable of wandering indoors to hide inside shoes in a dark closet or crash inside a little-used drawer.</p><p><strong>What to do if you see one: </strong>Don’t mess with it. According to the <a href=# data-name="www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/spiders/types.html#:~:text=Black%20Widows,-Photo%20courtesy%20of&text=They%20are%20identified%20by%20the,areas%20where%20debris%20has%20accumulated." data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, the brown recluse will bite humans if they’re unintentionally trapped against one’s skin. The venom causes severe lesions that may result in skin necrosis, requiring immediate medication intervention.</p><p><strong>How to prevent them: </strong>Block access to you home as you would with American house spiders. Also, don’t leave clothing and shoes on the floor. Or, at the very least, shake them out before wearing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.familyhandyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-984614590.jpg> <span class=credits-overlay><span class="image-credit noskim">David Rojas/Getty Images</span></span><h2>Grass Spiders</h2><p>Among the most common spiders found in and around the home, the shy grass spider (aka a funnel-web spider) builds dense, silk-lined webs/burrows to trap its insect victims. They’re also super fast runners.</p><p><strong>What they look like: </strong>Often confused with wolf or hobo spiders, grass spiders appear yellow, brown or cream-colored with two dark brown bands running across their bodies. They have long spinnerets (the silk-producing organ) and three rows of eyes arranged with two on top, four in the middle and two on the bottom. They average about 1/2-in. to 3/4-in. in size. Males are smaller.</p><p><strong>Where to find them: </strong>Native to North America, they’re happiest in short grassy areas or on windowsills.</p><p><strong>What to do if you see one: </strong>Nothing.</p><p><strong>How to prevent them: </strong>To avoid a home infestation, <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/article/good-bugs-for-your-garden/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links" rel="noopener noreferrer">mow the lawn</a> and keep tree branches and shrubbery well-trimmed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p63MoqOyoJGjsbq5wKdlnKedZLmqv9Noq7Kolah6sLKMoaauq5ViwLG1w56prGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lee-hodges.html><span>←</span><span>What is Lee Hodges's Career Earnings?</span></a>
