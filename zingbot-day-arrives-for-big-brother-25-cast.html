The comedian robot will arrive at the house to make jokes about the players.
Host Julie Chen Moonves announced that it would go down in Week 10.
And that means the BB25 cast will come across Zingbot on Saturday (October 7).
Reaching this point of the season is a milestone for the players.
It also comes shortly after Julie revealed that everyone left has made it to at least the BB25 jury."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
