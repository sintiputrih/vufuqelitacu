Cole For Snubbing Rap Media</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=#>Akademiks</a> has ripped into<a href=#> Kendrick Lamar,</a><a class=underline-link href=#>Drake</a> and <a href=#>J. Cole</a> for snubbing rap media, and said their egos were to blame.</p><p>Ak made the comments while watching J.

Cole and the rest of y’all big rappers no wonder y’all get shitted on by Hip Hop outlets man. Y’all get so big in the game…they use the culture and they use all these blogs, not saying you need to like, I don’t care if they do an interview with me, but I know a lot of journalists in the game and they won’t speak up and a lot of ’em still really hope to get an interview. I say fuck all these n-ggas.”</p><p>He continued, “Big Ak made it on his own, fuck these n-ggas in the interview. I just look at n-ggas like J. Cole when I see you doing some shit on ESPN but you wont do an interview with a n-gga in the culture, you won’t hop on Million Dollaz Worth of Game, you won’t hop on motherfucking Drink Champs, you won’t be with Joe Budden or something like that. I look at it as some weird shit.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Elsewhere he applauded Nicki Minaj for continuing to speak and interact with certain blogs and rap media outlets, and said these aforementioned outlets needed to stop “dick-sucking” A-list rappers. He added that Drake’s sitdown with Lil Yachty was cool, but that the 6 God was equally as guilty of avoiding rap outlets.</p><p>“I’m speaking for all the little journalists in the game who be like ‘Oh my God we can’t wait to get an interview with J. Cole going on’, that n-gga ain’t doing no interview with y’all. You know why? Most of these n-ggas don’t wanna be asked real questions. That’s the main thing. Once you get to a certain level you get to control the narrative.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/03/boosie-badazz-wack-100-dj-akademiks-react-to-6ix9ine-bloody-beatdown-250x142.png alt="Boosie Badazz, Wack 100 & DJ Akademiks React To 6ix9ine’s Bloody Beatdown" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Boosie Badazz, Wack 100 & DJ Akademiks React To 6ix9ine’s Bloody Beatdown</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>March 22, 2023</p></a><p>He went on to say, “n-gga if Kendrick don’t wanna fuck with you, tell that n-gga to kick rocks! I don’t wanna beg for no n-gga to give me no interview. That’s how all these outlets act. No, no we can’t be too mean to them because when their album comes around we wanna get like, no! They’re gonna go to some whitewashed outlet and go sit with some random n-gga or some random white dude and not talk to you.”</p><p></p><p>The comments come <a class=underline-link href=#>after Ak similarly came for Metro Boomin,</a> and tore apart the Grammy-award-nominated producer simply for asking him not to be included on his site.</p><p>Ak had reposted Metro’s apparent response to a snippet of <a class=underline-link href=#>a new song by Hit-Boy that heard him fire off disses about several other producers</a>. When Metro Boomin spotted his tweet, he commented on Akademiks’ IG post and “politely” asked “1 more time” to “not post me or anything to do with me on this page.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“@metroboomin respectfully my answer to ur request is F*CK No,” Ak replied. “Get the f*ck off my page. I don’t post for u. Nor do I care what u think bout what I posted bout u.
