Its logo. Go to a café in any big city, go to the mall, or walk around a university campus; there’s a pretty good chance someone is rocking a Stranger Things shirt. The show’s title and signature logo, with its red color and iconic font, have grown so popular that they’ve simply become a general and noticeable part of mainstream pop culture.</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=710 data-injectable=true>Speaking of that dashing crimson logo, for those interested in a bit of typography, the logo’s now famous typeface is known as “ITC Benguiat,” named after its founder, Ed Benguiat (per <a href=#>Vox</a>). And that special font is just one piece of an intricate puzzle when it came to crafting the show’s iconic intro sequence.</p><h2 id=h-stranger-things-has-arguably-one-of-the-greatest-title-sequences-in-streaming-today data-injectable=false>Stranger Things has arguably one of the greatest title sequences in streaming today</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/stranger-things.jpeg><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=666 data-injectable=true>In 2017, <a href=#>Vox</a> sat down with Michelle&nbsp;Dougherty of Imaginary Forces, the studio behind Stranger Things’ retro title opening. Dougherty broke down the creation process behind the title card and how crucial the opening was: “You want it to feel, original, you want it to feel like that title sequence couldn’t work in front of another show.”</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>Touching on the initial inspiration for the opening sequence, Dougherty discussed how the Matt and Ross Duffer, the creators of the hit <a href=#>Netflix</a> series, had sent her and her team paperback novels from the ’80s. Dougherty and Imaginary Forces saw a recurring pattern in the typography on the book covers and, with the help of the brilliant crew over at <a href=#>Contend</a>, went to work.</p><p data-characters=692 data-current-count=1071 data-injectable=true>Almost in a backstage homage to the show’s setting and how things were done before, Imaginary Forces got old-school with their work. In order to create a “grittier” and almost “imperfect” title card, Dougherty and her team printed out the required letters on an older type of film known as “Kodaliths” (per <a href=#>Vox</a>). Kodaliths can help create some high-contrasting images, and after blasting these letters with light to see how they would look, Imaginary Forces used the results as building blocks before finishing everything up with digital animation. And that’s how Stranger Things‘ opening sequence looks kind of modern, and kind of old, at the same time.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=1 data-current-count=1 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtqmasmJp6tMDOq7BmmpWdtq%2BwjK2fnmWjqb%2BiusaeqWasmJ67qL%2BMpaagp18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./suzie-ketcham-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Suzie Ketcham Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
