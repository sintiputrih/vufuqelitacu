It made me strong in places I didn’t know I needed to be. I have a butt now that I didn’t have during my modeling career!”</span></p><p><span>The </span><i><span>Tomatoes for Neela </span></i><span>author also shared more about her diet and busy filming schedule in a November 2021 interview with </span><a href=#><i><span>Parade</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“When I’m finished filming </span><i><span>Top Chef,</span></i><span> I eat a mostly plant-based diet,” she explained. “I’ll eat chicken or fish a couple times a week, some eggs, but it’s a lot of lentils, beans and tofu. I was raised a vegetarian and didn’t start eating meat until high school, so my body has a hard time digesting meat.”</span></p><p><span>In her downtime, Padma enjoys spending time with her daughter, <a href=#>Krishna</a>, who often joins her in the kitchen to prepare delicious dishes. The pair have the sweetest bond, one that has only gotten stronger over time.

That’s too dangerous!’” the doting mom told</span> <a href=#><i><span>Parents</span></i></a><span> in September 2020. “But she was adamant about doing it, so I walked her through the steps. … When I asked her how she knew how to do it, she said, ‘Mom, I’ve been watching you for years!’”</span></p><p><span>Krishna has also become her mom’s beach buddy! The mother-daughter duo love hitting the beach, soaking up the sun and sharing their sweet experiences on Instagram.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>See Padma’s gorgeous bikini photos so far.&nbsp;</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46pmJ2lkWK5orfSoaSiZZKeuKq6yGanoaekpMBursSsq2arp566tMHIrWSpoZOpwrOx0mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nonso-anozie-everything-you-need-to-know-about-him.html><span>←</span><span>Nonso Anozie- Everything You Need To Know About Him</span></a>
