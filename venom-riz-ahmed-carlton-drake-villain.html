And that’s where Venom really kicks off.</p><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=true>Truth be told, there are those who believe Ahmed’s character is actually a red herring, and that he’ll be playing&nbsp;Cletus Kasady (AKA Carnage) come October. Nevertheless, when the actor was quizzed about what makes Carlton Drake tick, Ahmed was pretty forthcoming, and outlined&nbsp;his character’s dream of accelerating human evolution.</p><p>Well my character is a billionaire industrialist, he’s an inventor, he’s a bit of a genius, and he’s really interested in trying to find a future for humanity as we face ecological collapse and war. For him, the solution lies in colonizing other planets. So it’s actually a kind of search for another suitable habitat for humanity, that leads him to the Symbiotes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Venom-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Venom.jpg><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>It’s this endeavor that leads him to the symbiotes (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sim-BEE-ote</a>) – goopy alien parasites with the power to utterly consume their hosts, thereby creating a third, entirely new entity. Such is the case with Eddie Brock, who encounters a particularly nasty symbiote, only to transform into Venom.</p><p data-characters=81 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>And Riz Ahmed? He’s not 100 percent convinced he’s playing a villain:</p><p>No one thinks that they are the bad guy, that’s the reality. People do crazy things, terrible things, but in their mind they justify it. They think that they’re helping the world, helping the other person, helping themselves, they justify it in their own ways. So, for me, when I’m playing a character like Carlton Drake, I’m sure you’ll think I’m crazy but I totally understand what he’s doing and why he’s doing it.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Venom-poste-2-670x344.jpeg alt="Venom Poster" width=640 height=329 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p data-characters=16 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>Ahmed concluded:</p><p>He’s trying to serve humanity and he just thinks that he’s best placed to do that and he wants to find a future for the human race. And of course, as the most rich, powerful, successful, intelligent member of the human race, he should be at the center of that future as well. So, I think I’m playing the good guy, but that’s sort of what everyone thinks.</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=719 data-injectable=false>As we alluded to before, Venom’s metamorphosis has evoked&nbsp;comparisons to Cronenberg and Carpenter, and we know that director&nbsp;Ruben Fleischer looked to the horror classics of yesteryear when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">creating his Spider-Man spinoff</a>. So on October 5th, we’ll discover if <strong>Venom</strong> really is more than the sum of its parts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorZ6mn6J6s7XZZpihpZWZeqSt0aWrqKZdmb%2Bit8RmraKknJa2r3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pokemon-go-catch-mastery-ghost-timed-research-guide.html><span>←</span><span>Pokmon GO Catch Mastery: Ghost Timed Research Guide</span></a>
