Such is the case with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Linus Tech Tips</strong></a>, an informative technology channel run by Linus Gabriel Sebastian. The channel, which was originally created in 2008, has blossomed into a catch-all for just about everything tech-related. The channel uploads videos on those mystery cords you’ve never used but come with every fresh computer, the inner workings of hard drives, and dozens of other topics my non-techy brain can never hope to understand.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Linus Sebastian’s age</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true>The Linus Tech Tips YouTube page launched on Nov. 4, 2008 — nearly 15 years ago, when Sebastian was in his early 20s. These days, he’s comfortably in his mid-30s, and his page has grown exponentially since those early days. He’s 36 in 2023, and — despite all the recent controversy — seems to be thriving overall.</p><h2 id=h-linus-sebastian-s-net-worth data-injectable=false>Linus Sebastian’s net worth</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=650 data-current-count=950 data-injectable=true>At least, not without the help of a channel like Linus Tech Tips. Since its start just under 13 years ago, the page has accumulated nearly 14 million subscribers. Those subscribers have, during that time, viewed uploads to the page more than 5 billion times. The majority of the page’s recent uploads, whether they be about motherboards or PC builds, gain at least a million views, with some managing to pull in more than 5 million. This staggering view count pays off in YouTube ad revenue, which yields between $3 and $7 per 1,000 views. With Linus Tech Tips gaining around 1.46 million daily views, that ad revenue adds (hah) up pretty fast.</p><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=222 data-injectable=false>And that’s only accounting for Sebastian’s main YouTube page. He also runs several sister pages — TechQuickie, ShortCircuit, and TechLinked — which, between them, boast more than 5 million additional subscribers.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=497 data-injectable=true>Linus Tech Tips alone makes around $357,000 monthly, which adds up to an impressive $2.64 million annually, based on estimations from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Net Worth Spot</a>. On the higher end, Sebastian may make more than $5 million a year, which seems more likely, given his other popular channels.</p><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>This gives the popular science and tech YouTuber a net worth of more than $21 million, on the low end. Once you add in the revenue Sebastian gains from his other YouTube channels, along with his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">online store</a>, his actual net worth is likely much higher. Higher, even, than Net Worth Spot’s inflated estimation of $30 million, and veering ever closer to more recent guesstimates, which credit him with as much as $85 million in the bank.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Linus Tech Tips controversy</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=563 data-current-count=863 data-injectable=false>Recent controversy around Sebastian’s business practices is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">casting doubt over years of popular content</a>, as his longstanding fans discover that inaccurate data and questionable business decisions are reportedly common. Quite a few of his viewers once took Sebastian at his word, and they’re now reexamining everything they’ve learned from the YouTuber over the years. More than a decade of misrepresenting products, leaning on “irresponsible” tests, and most importantly, bad data, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">is fast souring fans</a> on the once-popular YouTuber.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeppMK1wcGeZqGnp2K6tq%2FHZpuonaNiwKS1xKeanmWRo7FuwMScn2axn6rBtq7EZqean5Viuaq61KxkrZ2TnXq1tc%2BsZKaZm5p8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tiny-harris-fathers-day-tribute-ti-photo-message.html><span>←</span><span>Tiny Harris Posts Fathers Day Tribute To T.I.
