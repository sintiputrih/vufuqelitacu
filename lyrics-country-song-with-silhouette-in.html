Aaron Watson - Country Radio Lyrics
Ooh, silhouettes swaying across the wall Ooh-ooh, no we didn't have much Then again we had it all They made that little house a home Full of heart and soul Just like a love song on country radio They could sing 'em all, two-part harmony tune Like Loretta and Conway, Johnny and June I could hear momma laughing as daddy swept her off her feet COUNTRY MUSIC LYRICS"><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
