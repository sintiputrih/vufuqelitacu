<a href=../../../asus-rog-swift-pg278q-g-sync-monitor-review.html></a>
We've talked previously about G-SYNC and how it can provide a better experience for gaming, but one of the big limitations with G-SYNC on most monitors so far has been the maximum refresh rate of 60Hz. With the ASUS ROG Swift PG278Q, that particular limitation goes out the window as it can refresh at up to 144Hz. What this means is that for the vast majority of users, particularly when running at the native 2560x1440 resolution, your frame rates will no longer be limited by the refresh rate.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Is Disney Plus shutting down?</h2><time>Jul 13, 2024</time>

Taking a look back. Lea Michele may be best known for her role as Rachel Berry in Glee, but the actress’ life in the spotlight started long before that, as she made her debut on Broadway at the age of 8, playing a replacement Young Cosette in Les Misérables. Three years later, she played Little Girl in Ragtime.
Although she stepped away from the stage in 2009 when Ryan Murphy wrote the role of Rachel Berry for her specifically, her love for Broadway was written into the character.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Home Stereo System From Sharp Objects Can Be Yours for More Than $112,000</h2><time>Jul 13, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../sharp-objects-home-stereo-system-html.html></a>
Put on some creepy tunes. Aside from great actresses, overwhelming humidity, and pervasive dread, one of the most noteworthy aspects of Sharp Objects is its music. The show’s needle drops tend to come from diegetic sources, often an iPhone, or, as in the many creepy scenes in the Crellin family’s Victorian house, a sound system. When Alan Crellin (Henry Czerny) wants to retreat from the outside world, and ignore all the deep psychological drama playing out between his wife Adora (Patricia Clarkson) and stepdaughter Camille Preaker (Amy Adams), he puts on a sweater, drops some vinyl, and blasts whichever piano-heavy compositions he’s interested in at the moment.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/53/>← Prev Page</a>
