(Or F.R.I.E.N.D.S, as the popular opening credits spell it.) And that means multiple generations know about the six characters – Rachel, Joey, Chandler, Monica, Ross, and Phoebe – who became household names, almost as if they were not just each other's friends, but the public's as well. After 10 seasons of entertaining the masses, the show closed its curtains in 2004. We can safely say that the end of the last millennium and the beginning of the new one were closely intertwined with the show.</description></item><item><title>LYRICS: Chase Atlantic Empty</title><link>/lyrics-chase-atlantic-empty.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/lyrics-chase-atlantic-empty.html</guid><description>[Verse 1: Mitchel Cave]

実は帰国子女であることは、一般的には知られていません。
現在でもRADWIMPSの楽曲の中には、
英語の曲も多く収録されており、
出だしの頃に限っては英語が中心のバンドでした。
最近では、ブレイクした映画「君の名は。」の主題歌を、
映画の海外上映に合わせて「前前前世」の英語版が出されました。
野田洋次郎さんの英語の歌の発音はなかなかよく、
何かも無理や違和感を感じません。
しかし、実際には野田洋次郎さんの英語力はどれほどのレベルなのでしょうか？
野田洋次郎の英語(帰国子女)
RADWIMPSといえば、
日本語遊びの歌詞センスがよく、
その独自の表現がユーザーに評価されてます。
その一方で、
英語の歌詞の曲も、「まるで別のバンドみたい」と、
野田洋次郎さんの英語の歌も高評価なのです。
幼少期を海外で過ごした経験から、野田洋次郎さんは英語の発音はよく、
作詞する際は、普通のボーカリストよりもスムーズなのでしょう。
しかし、野田洋次郎さん本人に問えば、
海外にいた頃よりも、高校の頃の猛勉強の恩恵が強く、
自分の英語力はネイティブとはかけ離れてるそうです。
ちょっと素直すぎるというか、
カッコつけて「まぁね」と言わないあたりも、
野田洋次郎さんの魅力ですね・・・笑。
学生の頃から野田洋次郎さんは海外を意識しており、
バンドで食っていこうと夢みた頃から、
必然的に英語は重要と考えていたみたいです。
英語とロックの関わりの重要性に言及してたこともあったので、
野田洋次郎さんの英語への探究心はまだまだ続くと思います。
個人的は、英語版の「前前前世」が世界的に受け入れられれば、
RADWIMPSの海外へのレールになるのかな？と。
野田洋次郎が天才と呼ばれる理由 一度聞くと頭を離れない歌唱力と、
抜群の英語センス、作詞センス、
さらにはどの楽器もまんべんなくこなすという、
野田洋次郎さんの音楽性は非常にマルチで、
音楽関連のインタビューでも視野が広いことが伺えます。
歌が上手く、英語がうまく、楽器がなんでもできる、
このステータスだけを見れば、他にいますが、
野田洋次郎さんに関しては「才能を作品やライブで出してる」ということが重要です。
バンドの一部になってギターを弾けば、
ピアノでの弾き語りもできます。
また、英語の楽曲のクオリティの高さもあって、
まさに「天才」と評されてます。
日本語の言葉遊びのうまさも、
天才っぽく見られる大きな要因でしょう。
独自の音楽性を追求していって、
これからも大きく動きだす、
噴火寸前の火山のようなオーラも、
また彼の魅力の一つです。
飽くなき探究心で、
「うわっ」という音楽を作り続ける、
そんな予感を持つからこそ、
野田洋次郎さんは天才だと思われるのです。
