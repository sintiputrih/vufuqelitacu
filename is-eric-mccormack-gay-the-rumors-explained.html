But while Sean Hayes, who plays Jack and Will’s best friend in the series is openly gay, McCormack is not. The actor has even looked back at the show’s decision to rope him in to play a gay man, something he is happy to know won’t happen in today’s era of diversity and inclusivity.</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>Throughout the show’s eleven seasons, Will dated many men and eventually ended up with McCoy Whitman, played by Matt Bomer, who is openly gay in real life. Evidently, it was all enough to give rise to speculations about McCormack being gay, even though he was married to Janet Holden a year before the show started.</p><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=720 data-injectable=true>The rumors got brand new wings when the actor — who is an avid supporter of same-sex marriage — hilariously kissed his Will & Grace co-star, Hayes, during the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the show’s reboot back in 2017. Of course, his Will Truman also returning to the screens further ensured that any lingering logic left the chat of those huddled together to pass judgment on his private life.</p><p data-characters=113 data-current-count=113 data-injectable=false>So, is Eric McCormack gay? That’s a question only he gets to answer, when — and moreover, if — he wants to.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tHnEq6CcZZ2YsLC%2BzJqapGWXlsZuwMeeZKutnaS%2FtHnEsaelmZmjsqV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./every-song-taylor-swift-has-allegedly-written-about-joe-jonas.html><span>←</span><span>Every song Taylor Swift has (allegedly) written about Joe Jonas</span></a>
