Ben Cardin wins re-election, prevails over Republican Tony Campbell, independent Neal Simon<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=updated-on-6-november-2018></span>Updated on: 6 November 2018.<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Ben Cardin, the Maryland Democrat who has held elected office for more than 50 years, won his third term in the U.S. Senate Tuesday in a three-way race.</p><p>Cardin prevailed handily in a low-visibility contest in which the two challengers, Republican Tony Campbell and independent Neal Simon, struggled to gain statewide attention.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span></p><p>“As I traveled throughout Maryland, there is a lot of energy out there,” Cardin said at the Baltimore Museum of Industry, where he was celebrating. “They want to see an independent Congress — independent of the president. I heard that over and over again. People also want us to work across party lines to get things done.”</p><p>Campbell and Simon were trying to become the first non-Democrat to be a U.S. senator in Maryland since Republican Charles McC. Mathias Jr. retired in 1987</p><p>The contest was unusual because of the presence of a well-funded, unaffiliated candidate — Simon — who reported raising $1.8 million, including a $946,600 loan to his campaign.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_15"></span></p><p>Simon traveled around the state in a red-and-blue campaign bus that said “People over Politics” in white letters above his name. The Potomac wealth management executive accused both political parties of playing “partisan games and getting nothing done.”</p><p>Cardin, who raised $3.9 million, countered that he has often demonstrated the ability to work with both parties.</p><p>In campaign ads, the senator — using the tagline “My Friend Ben” — emphasized his role in helping to clean up the Chesapeake Bay, overhaul drinking water and wastewater systems, and safeguard health insurance protections for people with pre-existing conditions.</p><p>Live results: 2018 general election in Maryland »</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span></p><p>His Senate website includes a page called “Tracking the Trump Administration,” which has sections on President Donald Trump’s health care policies as well as “discriminatory or dangerous actions” and “conflicts of interest,” among other topics.</p><p>Cardin said the presence of Simon in the contest didn’t affect his strategy because “I generally run my race, whether it’s two people running” or more.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_13"></span></p><p>“We didn’t win this time,” Simon said in remarks prepared for delivery to supporters in Rockville. “But real change can be like chipping at a dam. You keep knocking down pieces, and eventually the river flows through.”</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_20"></span></p><p>Trump played a central role in the race’s only debate, with Cardin calling for a strong Senate to stand up to the president. Campbell, meanwhile, did not seek to distance himself from the president, as Republican Gov. Larry Hogan has done. Instead, he strongly endorsed some of Trump’s signature policies, including building a wall on the Mexican border and reducing the role of the U.S. Department of Education in local affairs. Simon said he did not vote for Trump but agreed with some of his actions, including moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span></p><p>Cardin,75, has been a fixture in Maryland politics since being elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in 1966. He has served in the General Assembly or Congress since then.</p><p>Campbell, 52, a Towson University political science lecturer, raised nearly $200,000. He did not receive the endorsement of Hogan, who said he was staying out of the race.</p><p>Simon said he recently ran into Hogan at a Baltimore food hall, and that the governor said he voted for the independent in early voting.

The letter underlines a number of concerns the Senators have regarding Maryland’s preparedness to ensure that all residents are counted.</p><p>The Senators begin, “We are writing to request an update on the status of Maryland’s plans to achieve a complete count in the 2020 census. As you know, the census is a critical responsibility under the Constitution. Moreover, as the Census helps determine allocations of federal funding, Maryland has a clear interest in counting every resident.”</p><p>They note, “We understand that while the State has distributed some funding to local governments and organizations through a grant application process, approximately $900,000 remains for additional allocation. We have heard from many counties and municipalities that we’re unaware of the application process or learned of it too late to apply and, consequently, have no funding to prepare for the census. These include many of Maryland’s historically undercounted jurisdictions. We have also received questions from leaders around the State inquiring as to the process for distribution of the remaining $900,000 funds. At this point, it is essential that funding be provided to the remaining jurisdictions so that all parts of the state can conduct effective outreach and marketing activities.”</p><p>The Senators continued, “We are deeply concerned that the State has not provided adequate guidance and support to the jurisdictions. The statewide Complete Count Committee has met a number of times this year, but we have been advised that its members can do little to plan critical outreach efforts without more information about intentions for these funds.”</p><p>The Senators close the letter, stating, “The 2020 Census is rapidly approaching, and it is critical that the State develop and implement a robust plan to count every Marylander. We stand ready to work with you to do all we can to ensure that all Marylanders participate in this critically important effort.”</p><p>The full text of the letter is available below and the copy is available here.</p><p>Dear Governor Hogan:</p><p>We are writing to request an update on the status of Maryland’s plans to achieve a complete count in the 2020 census. As you know, the census is a critical responsibility under the Constitution. Moreover, as the Census helps determine allocations of federal funding, Maryland has a clear interest in counting every resident.</p><p>Our effort requires engagement from every level of government as well as community leaders and requires resources to reach every household. We have been working to provide additional federal funding for the Census, including allowing the Census to spend what it needs in the Continuing Resolution that passed the Senate last week.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_24"></span></p><p>We understand that while the State has distributed some funding to local governments and organizations through a grant application process, approximately $900,000 remains for additional allocation.

Jurisdictions that did not receive earlier state funding are struggling to develop their own outreach plans while they await more information about the State’s strategic plan and availability of funding. We ask that you share the process for allocating the remaining funds and ensuring that information and guidance is communicated to local stakeholders.</p><p>The 2020 Census is rapidly approaching, and it is critical that the State develop and implement a robust plan to count every Marylander.
