The school was the first place where he was able to manifest his leadership skills. He was captain of the track team and ran for the student body presidency – unfortunately, with little success.</span></p><p><span data-color=var(--blue-10)>His campaign was based around helping orphans of the Korean War, and he still continued his efforts after losing the election.</span></p><p>Sanders first became interested in politics when he was really young. He <span data-color=var(--blue-10)>became aware of the fact that politics is important </span>when <span data-color=var(--blue-10)>he looked back at how </span>Adolf Hitler <span data-color=var(--blue-10)>won</span> an election in 1932, and 50 million people died as a result.&nbsp;</p><p><span data-color=var(--blue-10)>He lost both of his parents at a young age.

This longtime independence made the party switch largely.&nbsp;</p><p>Sanders made history as the only presidential candidate ever to be invited to the Vatican to speak on moral, environmental, and economic issues.&nbsp;<span data-color=var(--blue-10)>He was one of the few people who financed their campaign primarily from donations. He actually broke the fundraising record for the amount of money raised from contributions of U.S. citizens.</span></p><p><span data-color=var(--blue-10)>Sanders raised over $96 million, but that didn’t secure his success during the campaign, and the Democratic nomination went to Hillary Clinton.

This time he also heavily relied on private donations, rising $10 million in the first week of his campaign.

They’re working hard. They can’t afford to send their kids to college in many instances. They can’t afford child care for their little babies. They’re worried to death about retirement.” <strong>– Bernie Sanders</strong></p><p>“What being a socialist means is… that you hold out… a vision of a society where poverty is absolutely unnecessary, where international relations are not based on greed… but on cooperation… where human beings can own the means of production and work together rather than having to work as semi-slaves to other people who can hire and fire.” <strong>– Bernie Sanders</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=2-political-lessons-from-bernie-sanders></span>2 Political Lessons From Bernie Sanders&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Now that you know all about Bernie Sanders’ net worth and how he achieved success; let’s take a look at some of<span data-color=var(--blue-10)> the </span>best lessons that we can learn from him:</p><h3>1.
