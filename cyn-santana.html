Things turned out bad after Erica once again got involved with him. The attraction Erica felt for Rich, too, was noticeable, which caused tension between them and caused Erica and Cyn to butt heads. They stopped having fun, and more troubles came arising.&nbsp;</p><p>Erica was spotted kissing Bow Wow at “106 & Park” and became the effective end of their relationship. Eventually, the couple grew into more misunderstandings, and they broke up.

After going through the experience, she posted a video on her insta advising moms about postpartum depression where she stated:&nbsp;</p><p>“‘...you gonn get through it. Postpartum depression. There’s so many layers to it. The hormonal changes, the mental changes, the physical changes but I wanna start with the spirit first,” she captioned a video that offered even more advise.&nbsp;</p><p>And she also encouraged the moms to take professional help. Also, she expressed:&nbsp;</p><p>“Of course, you should probably go to the doctor, and speak to somebody about how you feel,” she concludes. “Some women take medicine. Some women take vitamins.
