She comes from a middle-class family consisting of her father, Karamo Chilombo, her mother, Christina Yamamoto, and her four siblings.&nbsp;Growing up was a bittersweet experience for her.&nbsp;She has revealed that she still has memories of the horrific 1992 incident that saw Rodney King police brutality.&nbsp;This mistreatment led to an uprising in solidarity with the victim.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the violent riots resulted in the deaths of over 50 people and 2,000 injuries.&nbsp;Also, as a child, Jhené did not have a pleasant experience at school because she was constantly teased about her appearance, which did not fall into the popular racial classifications.</span></p><p><span>Still, the wonderful part of her childhood was the music.&nbsp;Whenever she was sad, music was her concern to take her time and comfort.&nbsp;She began taking music and singing lessons at the age of four.&nbsp;To make things more interesting, her older sisters Jamila and Miyoko were already in the limelight with an R&B music group called “Gyrl”.&nbsp;Through her sisters, she had the opportunity to introduce her singing skills to then-producer Chris Stokes at the age of five.&nbsp;By the time she was seven, Jhené Aiko had written quite a few rap songs.</span></p><h2><strong><span>music career</span></strong></h2><p><span>She has always been influenced by music as her older sisters were already successful singers.&nbsp;She later became part of the R&B boy group,&nbsp;</span><span>B2K,</span><span>&nbsp;and signed with Epic Music when she was just twelve years old.&nbsp;She was also featured in the group’s debut video album,&nbsp;</span><span>Uhhh</span><span>&nbsp;, in 2002. Surprisingly, the video won the BET Award for Viewer’s Choice.&nbsp;In 2003, Jhené Aiko attempted to release her debut album (My Name is Jhene) through record labels such as Sony, The Ultimate Group and Epic.&nbsp;However, it didn’t work out and the album was never released as a result of differences faced between the labels and themselves.</span></p><p><span>Even more, she had a strong desire to pursue hereducation, so she decided to get out of business.&nbsp;After completing her studies, she returned to the music scene in 2011 with a mixtape entitled “Sailing Souls”.&nbsp;Among them were actors like Drake, Miguel and Kanye West.&nbsp;Following the success of the mixtape and a growing fan base, she was signed to Artium Record Imprints through Def Jam the next year.&nbsp;Her first EP, “Sail Out,” was released in November 2013 and it did so well that it reached #1 on the R&B chart.&nbsp;Her follow-up album “Trip” was released in 2017.</span></p><strong><span>Parents, ethnicity, siblings</span></strong><p><span>It’s pretty obvious that Aiko doesn’t fit any popular racial classification perfectly and the reason is simply that she’s of mixed heritage.&nbsp;Her father, Karamo Chilombo, a pediatrician, is African American, Native American, Jewish and German.&nbsp;On the other hand, her mother, Christina Yamamoto, also has a mix of Japanese, Dominican, and Spanish heritage.</span></p><p><span>She also has four siblings, two sisters (JamilaAkiko Mila Chilombo and Miyoko Chilombo) and two brothers (Miyagi Hasani Ayo Chilombo and Jahi Chilombo).&nbsp;Sadly, her brother Miyagi Hasani passed away on April 19, 2012 after losing a battle with cancer.&nbsp;Before his death, Aiko wrote a song for him called “For My Brother”.&nbsp;Shortly after hearing it, he gave up the ghost.&nbsp;She also has three other half-siblings from her father’s side.&nbsp;Their names are;&nbsp;Dio Chilombo, Kareena Chilombo and Marcia Chilombo.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Personal life – married, husband, daughter</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jhené Aiko is every inch a gorgeous lady who has had a good number of relationships since her popularity grew in her chosen field.&nbsp;In 2005, she began dating prolific R&B singer O’Ryan, and they both welcomed a daughter named Namiko Love on November 19, 2008.&nbsp;That same year her daughter was born, she and her boyfriend O’Ryan called it ending their relationship.</span></p><p><span>After the split, the couple was still very much on good terms and they traded co-parenting.&nbsp;A major tragedy was averted on August 27, 2013 after she, her older sister Miyoko, their daughter Namiko and ex-boyfriend O’Ryan were involved in a car accident.&nbsp;Luckily no life was lost and she alone had broken a wrist and had to sew up her chin.</span></p><p><span>On March 16, 2016, news broke that the star had secretly married her husband, Oladipo “Dot da Genius” Omishore.&nbsp;The couple began dating in late 2015.&nbsp;Unfortunately, that marriage didn’t last a year as Aiko filed for divorce and found irreconcilable differences.&nbsp;The marriage was finally dissolved in October 2017.&nbsp;Aiko and Big Sean are currently dating after splitting from her husband Oladipo.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><span class=vce-square></span><h2 class=entry-title><a href=# title="Who is Cassandra Marino?
