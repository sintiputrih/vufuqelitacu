Male turkeys, also called “Tom Turkeys” or “Gobblers” puff up their bodies and spread their tail feathers (just like a peacock). This fancy turkey trot helps the male attract females (also called “hens”) for mating.Click to see full answer. In this regard, what does it mean when a turkey fans his feathers? Social structure and mating Males are polygamous, mating with as many hens as they can. Male wild turkeys display for females by puffing out their feathers, spreading out their tails and dragging their wings. This behavior is most commonly referred to as strutting.Secondly, do turkey hens fan their feathers? Turkey Hens Hens bear less colorful feathers than males, with rusty brown, white or gray-tipped breast feathers. Their heads are either white or blue-gray, with small feathers on both head and neck. Hens do not strut or fan their tails. Also know, why does a turkey’s face turn blue? The color of a turkey’s head and throat will change depending on his mood. When a male turkey is excited, his head will turn blue. When he is feeling stressed, his head will turn bright red. The color shifts and changes many times throughout the day as he feels various levels of stress and relaxation.What are most turkey feathers used for after the turkey is plucked?White feathers have no spots under the skin when plucked. Most turkey feathers are composted. Turkey feathers were used to stabilize arrows and adorn ceremonial dress, and the spurs on the legs of wild tom turkeys were used as projectiles on arrowheads.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSesrSu1LOxZ5ufonuotI6wn7JllKR6tcHRpJyyq12brq95zq6rZqyYmrazecWemK2glafAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sean-rash.html><span>←</span><span>Sean Rash</span></a>
