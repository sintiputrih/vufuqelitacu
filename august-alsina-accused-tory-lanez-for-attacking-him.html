<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>August Alsina Accused Tory Lanez For Attacking Him</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>August Alsina</strong>, who shared a photo of blood pouring from his lips, accused Tory Lanez of beating him with a gang of thugs. Alsina can be seen stunned and lying against an elevator wall, blood streaming down his lips, in the Instagram image.&nbsp;Alsina detailed everything about the event in her article, but the additional proof is still expected.</p><h2>Tory Lanez allegedly assaulted August Alsina.</h2><p>August Alsina stated how rapper Tory Lanez assaulted him in an Instagram photo that he posted as proof.&nbsp;Alsina said that he was leaving a concert when Tory and a bunch of his bodyguards approached and surrounded him. Tory questioned August why he hadn’t “dap him up” sooner, and the latter said that it was because Tory had attacked him a few years back when he revealed his relationship with Jada Pinkett Smith.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Tory-Lanez.jpg alt="Tory Lanez" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Alsina assumed Lanez disliked him, so pretending they were buddies was pointless. Alsina stated that Lanez hit him as he was attempting to flee the scene and that this was not a fight but an attack.&nbsp;August said that Tory’s team had videotaped the whole event and requested that the clip be released. Alsina said that he uploaded the whole thing so that everyone may learn the full story. Meanwhile, Lanez said everything was fake and claimed to be in the studio. For the time being, an official statement from the Chicago Police Department is needed to determine if a police complaint has been made.</p><h2>Rumors of an argument between August Alsina and Tory Lanez</h2><p>Rumors of a physical incident between August Alsina and Tory Lanez surfaced when @GOTCITYTEA tweeted that they got into a fight after an online chat. According to the tweet,</p><p>“Tory Lanez KO’d August Alsina tonight after August became froggy with Tory months ago over something Tory said.” Tory was attempting to show him love, but August took it too far and was knocked out!”</p><p>In another tweet, the page added that August was incorrect and that he felt the same way after Tory indicated that he would not have “snitched” on Jada like him. The post went on to say that Lanez attempted to shake hands with Alsina, who ignored him and became hostile.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/August-Alsina-1.jpg alt="August Alsina" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>The Neighborhood Talk attempted to corroborate the story on Instagram by sending a message to Lanez. He loved it and remarked on it, stating it was an accident. Alsina is a well-known vocalist who has released albums such as Testimony, This Thing Called Live, The Product III: the State of Emergency, and others. Lanez, on the other hand, is a rapper who rose to prominence with the publication of his mixtape Conflicts of My Soul: The 416 Story and tracks such as Say It, Luv, and others.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>August Alsina</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Tory Lanez</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYrp%2BlqMFurcusoKeZXZawpMHSnptmrJ%2Bnxm64wKecs2WWpL9urdOtmJyjmaO0brTIpmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-middle.html><span>←</span><span>The Middle (TV) Cast - All Actors and Actresses</span></a>
