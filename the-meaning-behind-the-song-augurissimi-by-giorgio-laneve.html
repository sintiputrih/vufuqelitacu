One such song that has resonated with me deeply is “Augurissimi” by Giorgio Laneve. I first stumbled upon this song at a friend’s house, and I was captivated the moment I heard it.</p><p>“Augurissimi” is a beautiful Italian song that celebrates the simple joys and well wishes in life. It is a melodic expression of positive sentiments and wishes for happiness, directed towards various objects and aspects of everyday life. The lyrics exude a sense of warmth and goodwill, making it an incredibly uplifting song.</p><p>The song begins with the familiar phrase “Tanti auguri a te!” which translates to “Best wishes to you!” It sets the tone for the rest of the song, as Laneve goes on to send well wishes to different things in life. From wishing the taps and faucets not to have any defects to hoping that the sidewalks are not worn down by countless footsteps, Laneve’s lyrics beautifully capture the essence of positivity and gratitude.</p><p>The chorus, “Per te, per voi, per noi, per lui, per lei, per i vostri e per i miei, ecco cosa canterei, ecco il coro che vorrei… Augurissimi!” translates to “For you, for you all, for us, for him, for her, for yours and mine, here’s what I would sing, here’s the chorus I’d like… Best wishes!” This part emphasizes the song’s inclusive nature, as Laneve extends his well wishes beyond himself to encompass everyone.</p><p>The second part of the song expresses wishes for various objects and elements in life. Laneve hopes that shoes and boots never cause discomfort, that the stove continues to provide warmth without growing tired, and that the elevator doesn’t develop a heartache. It’s these little details that make “Augurissimi” so charming and relatable.</p><p>The song concludes with the heartfelt line, “Tanti auguri al calendario, per un anno straordinario, tanti auguri a tutte le cose, così modeste e così preziose” which means “Best wishes to the calendar, for an extraordinary year, best wishes to all the things, so modest and so precious.” This ending encapsulates the overarching theme of the song – appreciating the small yet significant blessings in life.</p><p>Giorgio Laneve’s “Augurissimi” was released as part of his album titled “Accenti” in 1976. It’s a testament to Laneve’s ability to create a song that touches the hearts of listeners even decades after its release.</p><p>Personally, this song holds a special place in my heart because it serves as a reminder to cherish the simple joys in life. Whenever I find myself caught up in the chaos of everyday life, I play “Augurissimi” and let its cheerful melody and uplifting lyrics wash over me. It inspires me to be grateful for the little things and to spread positivity to those around me.</p><p>In conclusion, “Augurissimi” by Giorgio Laneve is a delightful song that encapsulates the beauty of well wishes and gratitude. Its joyful melody and heartfelt lyrics truly resonate, reminding us to appreciate life’s simple pleasures. So, let’s join Laneve in extending our best wishes to all the things that make our lives remarkable.
