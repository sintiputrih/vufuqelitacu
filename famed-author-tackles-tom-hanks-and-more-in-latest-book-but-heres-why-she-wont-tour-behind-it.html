We’ve all been living through a global pandemic which meant changing, restricting, evolving, and growing in ways we never anticipated — not even in our wildest dreams.</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>In Patchett’s wildest dreams, she likely never saw a friendship blossoming later in life that would lead her to become a safe haven for a woman fighting against cancer.</p><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=271 data-injectable=false>She met Sooki Raphael, Tom Hanks’ personal assistant, at an event in Washington D.C. where Patchett interviewed Hanks, who had just published a book of his own. What happened next would become the story of Patchett’s next book,&nbsp;These Precious Days.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=106 data-current-count=377 data-injectable=false>Patchett says she feels lucky for that time in her life, lucky to have been the safe place Raphael needed.</p><p>”The luck and the fortune of my life was just overwhelming, and the key was that she was with us when she could have been with 100 other people who would have wanted her. She could have been shipwrecked on their island, and somehow she got shipwrecked on ours, and we all felt so lucky.”</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>From the way she describes her friend and their time together, it’s easy to assume that this read will be an emotional one for all of us. If you know someone fighting cancer, if you know someone struggling with anything at all, or even if you just profoundly value and appreciate your friendships — it’ll be a poignant read.</p><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>Patchett went on to discuss being an introvert, specifically one who works from home — so basically, she’s been ready for the pandemic’s restrictions for her entire life.</p><p>“I’m an introvert, and I’m an introvert who works from home. So I feel like I’ve been in training for this one my whole life. Tell me that I can’t leave my house? Oh yeah, I’m gonna be fine with that.”</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=true>She says the value of her life is that she can write books, and being at home is an excellent place for her to do that. She’s got an imagination that allows her to make the most of her surroundings, even when she’s just sitting at her favorite place.</p><p>“Eudora Welty didn’t go anywhere. Emily Dickinson didn’t go anywhere. The value of my life is that I can write books, and I’m going to get a lot more of them written in my house — and I have a great imagination.”</p><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>We can’t argue with that. You can read <strong>Patchett’s</strong> latest book, These Precious Days, now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonZqllZl6osHToaarZaSWsKy4xKxkraedYrWiusqsZJqmlGK6sL7EZqCnZZyWwaa%2F02aZqKebYq%2B2wIyhnKudo2LEqcWMrJ%2BeZaeku7V506isq2WSmrWqusNmoK1n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./elizabeth-clare-cullen.html><span>←</span><span>Elizabeth Clare Cullen</span></a>
