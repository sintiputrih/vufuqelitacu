Since its inception in 1911, the winner's take-home check has grown significantly. For instance, Ray Harroun received $14,250 as the winner's earnings in the inaugural year. This amount has soared over time, with the 2023 Indy 500 featuring a purse of $16 million, the largest in the competition's history.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Prize Money Breakdown</h2><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>2023 Indy 500</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Last year's competition distributed a record $16 million to the race's participants, with the winner, Marcus Ericsson, walking away with a substantial sum of $3.1 million, marking just the second time that the race's cash prize exceeded $3 million.
