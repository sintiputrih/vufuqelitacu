Prince made a departure from his trademark style this week, attending the NAACP Theatre Awards in Los Angeles dressed in a conventionally smart outfit – surprising his fans.
The 27-year-old opted to wear a tailored black suit, complete with buckled shoes and a classic blue shirt for the occasion, proving he wears formal attire just as well as he rocks his usual casual clothing."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
