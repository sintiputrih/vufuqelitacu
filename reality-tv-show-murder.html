When the would-be predators arrived, TV personality Chris Hansen was there with a full camera crew and a real-life police squad to detain them.</p><p>On November 5, 2006, <a href=#>Louis William “Bill” Conradt, Jr.</a> became inextricably linked to the show when local law enforcement conducted a sting in Texas, where he was a practicing Assistant District Attorney.</p><p>Conradt was caught soliciting minors for sex online, but when SWAT team members arrived at his home to serve the arrest warrant, Conradt shot himself.</p><p>The show continued for a year after, with Conradt’s family settling quietly out of court.</p><h2>Megan Wants To Marry A Millionaire</h2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAHr8ipBtnM</p><p>Attempting to seize on the success of VH1’s Rock Of Love With Bret Michaels, the network debuted Megan Wants A Millionaire in 2009. The show followed the life of Megan Hauserman, a one-time Rock of Love contestant who claimed that her ultimate goal was to become a trophy wife.</p><p>In the series, VH1 asked single men with a net worth of more than $1 million to compete for the young reality star’s love. Shortly after its August 2, 2009 premiere, however, the show was abruptly canceled. A grisly murder-suicide involving contestant Ryan Jenkins, a Canadian real estate investor and contestant, had been discovered.</p><p>Jenkins, who was rumored to have placed third in the show, married swimsuit model Jasmine Fiore shortly after the show’s premiere — and in less than 48 hours of knowing her.</p><p>The model from Santa Cruz, California was discovered on August 15, 2009, strangled and stuffed into a suitcase. Her remains were so mutilated that only the serial numbers on her breast implants enabled her identification.</p><p>Jenkins was the only suspect in the case and was immediately charged with the murder. He would never face a courtroom, however. On August 23, 2009, Jenkins was found hanging in a Canada hotel room. Police later found <a href=#>a suicide note</a> on his computer hard drive.</p><p>The murder-suicide prompted an immediate cancellation of the series. Hauserman went on to reveal in <a href=#>a People magazine article</a> her fear that she could have been Jenkins’ next victim.</p><p>Next, check out how the <a href=#>Slender Man myth led people to kill</a>. Then, discover <a href=#>five criminals who say that popular works of fiction inspired their crimes</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyzscCloK2xXanDbr%2FHqK5mpaWnsaa%2Bjms%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nokia-n8-review.html><span>←</span><span>N8 Display Quality, simple HTPC with HDMI out</span></a>
