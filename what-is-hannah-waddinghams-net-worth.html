She played a Factory Woman, likely lending her vocals to the soundtrack. It is unclear what Waddingham would have made in this role, but seeing as the film grossed nearly $150 million, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to The Numbers</a>, at the very least she hopefully got a generous paycheck.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=746 data-injectable=true>Waddingham has also had rolled on several hit TV shows, including Game of Thrones and Sex Education.

Though her salary for the long-awaited sequel is unclear, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly reports</a> was one of the most streamed Disney Plus films of all time, so they likely cut her a nice check.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=607 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>Of course, her most iconic role will always be in Ted Lasso.
