Not only are the ever-changing plotlines super intense, but the characters are very relatable. While <a href=# class=T3D>Hanna Marin understands back-to-school woes</a>, <a href=# class=T3D>Aria Montgomery understands your fashion struggles</a>. Considering everything the five Liars have gone through, it's reasonable that they have some words of wisdom we should all adopt in our daily lives.</p><p>This wisdom often re-surfaces thanks to fans live-tweeting <i>Pretty Little Liars</i> or just marathoning the show on Netflix. (Let's be honest, you can never watch it too many times, and in many cases, re-watching helps remind us of all of the crazy plot lines.) Some of the quotes stick with us because they are just that funny and totally true to the quirky nature of <i>PLL</i>. Others just haunt us because they have the biting edge of A's voice.</p><p>In any event, there are some quotes that are too good to not be used in everyday life. I gathered a few of them so you can slowly integrate them into conversations. Whether you're a long-time <i>Pretty Little Liars</i> fan or have never seen the show, it's never too early to incorporate these quotes into your life.</p><h3>1.

"10 Feet Away From My Lilacs!" — Veronica Hastings</h3><p>While this refers to something slightly (okay, very) dark, it's a fun phrase to drop at random.</p><h3>11. "Different's Good. I Like Different." — Toby</h3><p>Awww, early-era Toby! Before he was one half of the Spoby power couple, Toby dispensed some pretty smart advice to Emily.</p><h3>12.

In any case, it's also useful to drop when feeling overly stressed.</p><h3>13. "Oh, Please. I'd Rather Stick A Knife In The Toaster." — Veronica</h3><p>Slay, Veronica Hastings, slay. Another versatile quote for day-to-day life.</p><h3>14. "Sometimes Things Look Bad And They're Really Not. Sometimes There's Another Explanation For What's Going On." — Emily</h3><p>Trust Emily to see things from the bright side.</p><h3>15. "I Can't Run Around Without A Phone.

If You So Much As Touch One Hair On Their Heads, I Will Make You Very Sorry." — Spencer</h3><p>For when you're a protective Mama Bear looking after her cubs.</p><p>Now go forth and drop <i>Pretty Little Liars</i> quotes in your daily life.</p><p><i>Images: ABC Family (screenshot); <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Giphy</a> (17)</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyfZJrbGtlYWx6sb7ErauyZZyewbW4xGajopmiqHqywc6tnKxllqS%2FbrHVnqmynJGueq21xZ5kraCRqXqxvs6vnGasmJp6s7vSnq6op5RitKK6xmaenqyjYsawwQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./288199-will-smith-caught-making-fun-bald-people-html.html><span>←</span><span>Will Smith Caught Making Fun of Bald People before He Stood up for His Wifes Alopecia</span></a>
