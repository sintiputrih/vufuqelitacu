She also claims that he would display annoyance at public events when photographers requested solo photos of her.</p><p>Despite her efforts to salvage the marriage, Taylor asserts that Shumpert’s behavior became unbearable, characterizing their relationship as an “emotional rollercoaster.”</p><p>While Taylor originally downplayed talk of infidelity in her September announcement, mentioning that it was not a reason for their separation, the divorce filing reportedly includes allegations of infidelity. The legal documents also reveal a previous 2022 divorce filing that Taylor retracted the following day.</p><p>Taylor is currently seeking primary physical custody of their two children, as well as joint legal custody and child support. These details shed light on the underlying issues that contributed to the couple’s separation.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiqoqaXmr9uwMSymKeZXamuurjOq2SfoZyawG6yzqtknaGmpL%2BksYyfqailXZ66orqMrJ%2BupaCav7V5wKWjnp%2BZo7Rutc2foJ2dnJ7BunnAp5tmpZWjwaK4jJqZrquVZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brian-flores-nationality-where-is-he-from.html><span>←</span><span>Brian Flores Nationality: Where Is He From?</span></a>
