<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Brian Camp Obituary Douglasville Georgia, Brian Camp Has Died</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Brian Camp Obituary, Death Cause –&nbsp;</strong>It is with a heavy heart and profound sadness that we share the news of the passing of retired Douglas County S.O. Lieutenant Brian Camp. This evening, we received the somber report that Brian may have suffered a heart attack while engaged in a seemingly routine activity—chopping wood on his property. Brian dedicated over 30 years of his life to the Department, retiring as a Lieutenant just a few short years ago.</p><p>During my time at the Department in the late 2010s, Brian was a prominent figure in the Training Division, leaving a lasting impact on those he worked with. Beyond his dedication to law enforcement, Brian was a man of many passions. An avid fisherman, he found solace and joy in the tranquility of the outdoors. Additionally, he was a well-known singer and songwriter, leading the popular band “Brian Camp and the Georgia River Band” that resonated throughout Northwest Georgia.</p><p>I personally attest to Brian’s character as a good man, and his loss leaves a void that will be felt by all who knew him. As we come to terms with this heartbreaking news, let us unite in keeping Brian’s family and friends in our thoughts and prayers. May they find strength and solace during this difficult time. Rest in peace, Brother Brian, your legacy will endure in the memories of those fortunate enough to have crossed paths with you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaJqinq6vecKapKlln5e2tcHAq7BmnJ%2BqtK2t0q%2BgpaSVYrSmu9GgoJplkqe2orqMnJimqF2drrR5w6KcnWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rattata-pok-c3-a9mon.html><span>←</span><span>Rattata (Pokmon) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
