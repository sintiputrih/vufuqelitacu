While we are waiting to dive into the next season of <strong>The Real Housewives of New York</strong>, many are wondering what is going on with Lyons' love life. She has, in the past, talked about how <a href=#>she is not bringing her girlfriend into the show</a> but we may have gotten a bit of insight into their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Lyons was recently</a> doing an interview on <strong>The Drink with Kate Snow </strong>and Lyons opened up about her relationship with Bird. Well, in the way that Lyons does where <a href=#>she barely gave any kind of information</a> about the two of them, but <strong>Kate Snow </strong>did get a little bit of information out of the fashion icon. When talking with Lyons, she brought up being in love and Snow then asked about her relationship status. Lyons confirmed she was with someone (Bird) and even confirmed it is not the person she was seeing in her first season on <a href=#>The Real Housewives of New York</a>. But Lyons also did clarify that Bird would not appear in Season 15 but that she is talking about her. (The series is still shooting.) “She’s not on the show,” Lyons confirmed. “But we talk about her. I talk about her. I’m open about that, for sure.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-real-housewives-of-new-york-city-tv-show-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>The Real Housewives of New York City</h5>TV-14Reality TV<p class=display-card-description></p><p data-testid=plot>A fast-paced reality show that follows several incredibly busy and ambitious Manhattan women.

It felt like Lyons did not want anyone to know about it, and now she lights up when she gets to talk about Bird. Even though she won't be on the series, this lighter version of <strong>Lyons is going to make for a more interesting Season 15,</strong> and she even said that it was much easier to film this time around. Congratulations to both Lyons and Bird for finding each other.
