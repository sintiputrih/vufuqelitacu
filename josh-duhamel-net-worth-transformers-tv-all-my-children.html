For several years, he memorably played Leo du Pres in the hit ABC soap opera All My Children. And then from there, Duhamel pretty much took Hollywood by storm.</p><p>Just like that, the actor nabbed lead roles left and right. Not to mention, he also joined Michael Bay’s massively successful Transformers franchise.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Megan Fox Didn't Return For Transformers 3</a></span></p><p>Indeed, Duhamel has established himself as both a movie and TV star. And as many know, he’s become quite the <a href=#>Netflix</a> star too.</p><p>More importantly, he’s made it clear that he’s more than just a Transformers star. And that might explain why his net worth has grown tremendously since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated September 2023</strong>: If there is one thing that Josh Duhamel has been since making his last 'Transformers' movie in 2017, it is busy. On both the big and small screen, Duhamel has been over 25 projects since 2017 and has more on the way in various stages of production. As such, Duhamel will continue to be a force in the entertainment industry for some time to come and will only continue to grow his net worth.</p><p>In addition to having a successful professional life, Duhamel's personal life has been equally successful.</p><p>After his 13-year marriage to Fergie ended 2019, Duhamel knew that he wanted to get married again and have more kids. Fortunately, he met his future wife, Audra Mari just a short time after his divorce from Fergie was finalized. The two married in September 2022, and just recently announced they are expecting their first child together.</p><h2 id=josh-duhamel-memorably-made-his-movie-debut-in-the-popular-rom-com-win-a-date-with-tad-hamilton>Josh Duhamel Memorably Made His Movie Debut In The Popular Rom-Com Win A Date With Tad Hamilton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/movie-review-win-a-date-with-tad-hamilton-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in the early 2000s, Duhamel was making a name for himself in TV. Aside from All My Children, he also booked a role in the crime drama Las Vegas. But then, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he and his team learned that casting for the rom-com </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!</a> and quickly sprang into action.</p><p>"Part of the reason I got this job was because [my publicist] was really smart in using some footage we had from what we call Super Soap weekend in Florida, where the biggest fans basically from ABC daytime would go to this big event at Disney World," Duhamel explained.</p><p>He went on to say, "You go to this thing and every single person there knows you. It's the weirdest thing."</p><p>In some ways, the event also even helped Duhamel get into character even before he got cast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Because everybody knows you, you feel like you're Tad Hamilton walking down the boulevard in Disney World,” he explained. “It was a microcosm of what it's actually like for somebody like that – Tom Cruise or whatever, [so] I did have a sense of what it would feel like."</p><p>Of course, <a href=#>his 13-year marriage to Fergie</a> also helped propel Duhamel into the spotlight.</p><h2 id=josh-duhamel-has-since-gone-on-to-pursue-both-tv-and-film-successfully>Josh Duhamel Has Since Gone On To Pursue Both TV And Film Successfully</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/josh-duhamel-julianne-hough-get-down-to-some-filming-of-their-movie-safe-haven.jpg><p>Just a couple of years after the release of Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!, Duhamel got cast in Bay’s Transformers as Captain Lennox. Since then, the actor had starred in all the follow-up Transformers movies, with the exception of Transformers; Age of Extinction.</p><p>For Duhamel, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the franchise was more than just another Hollywood paycheck</a>. Instead, it essentially paved the way for him to establish himself as a star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I feel very blessed to be a part of it," Duhamel explained. "It’s not easy to be a part of a franchise that’s this successful, so I never really take any job for granted, but this one really kind of changed the trajectory of my career in a lot of ways, since it’s so global."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Jennifer Lopez And Josh Duhamel Really Felt About Working With Each Other In Shotgun Wedding</a></span></p><h3 id=since-becoming-a-transformers-star-duhamel-has-gone-on-to-star-in-many-films-those-films-include><strong>Since becoming a Transformers star, Duhamel has gone on to star in many films.

While salary figures surrounding his movies have never been disclosed, it stands to reason that much of Duhamel’s wealth came from decades of acting.</p><p>On the other hand, Duhamel has also worked hard to diversify his portfolio over the years.</p><p>For starters, he’s entered into various brand endorsement deals throughout his career. One of them involves a campaign to promote his home state of North Dakota. This is one partnership that has been going on since 2013 and as far as North Dakota is concerned, it can go on forever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, they’ve just extended the contract with the actor, a move that simply made perfect sense.</p><p>"He has helped expand our image and awareness of our state," Otte Coleman, who heads North Dakota tourism, explained. "He’s a great ambassador for our state and cares about where he comes from."</p><p>In addition, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Duhamel also serves as the brand ambassador, part-owner, and equity investor</a> of the Canadian athleisure brand Lolë. Their partnership began back in 2019 and for the company, they couldn’t have picked anyone better.</p><p>"As an understated style icon, he has good instincts when it comes to fashion," Lolë CEO, Todd Steele, said in a press statement. "His participation in design workshops with product teams is an exciting opportunity for us to continue to inspire people to live outside their comfort zones in style."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And as busy as Duhamel may be these days, the actor’s Hollywood calendar is quite full too. He recently released Buddy Games: Awakening and has a film, Not Without Hope in post-production, just waiting to be finished when the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strike comes to an end.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKuYYrG2tMCmnKVlnprBbsPOq6uhZaSnrq%2B%2Fxaippp2iqHq1woyao6Vlna56pLTIpZurnZ5k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alec-benjamin-3.html><span>←</span><span>Alec Benjamin Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</span></a>
