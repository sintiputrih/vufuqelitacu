Luckily everyone from <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></a> to<strong> Rihanna</strong> can help us out.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>While Miley’s been spotted recently in more feminine looks, there was a period of time where the singer, 26, opted for more athletic ensembles. One of her best looks during this phase came when she stepped out rocking a&nbsp;<strong>Chicago Bulls</strong> jersey… and not much else. She basically turned the oversized top into a dress, forgoing pants altogether. Hey, if you’re looking for a sexy way to wear a jersey, it doesn’t get much better than that! She rounded out her outfit with a backwards black baseball cap, strappy sandals and some gold jewelry.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Miley opted to wear her Bulls jersey long, but there’s another sexy take to try: wearing it cropped!&nbsp;<strong>Cara Delevingne</strong> was once spotted in West London repping the Chicago team on a small black and red jersey that showed off her lower abs. She paired the top with grey and black low-rise jeans, white sneakers, and a large tote bag.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cara-d-wearing-jersey-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Rihanna’s take on basketball jerseys was a little more conventional. She looked great in a <strong>San Antonio Spurs&nbsp;</strong>jersey which she paired with dark pants and a black purse.
