I sold 30 million, I lose <strong>Lüc [Carl</strong>],” Gaga explained. “I get the movie [A Star Is Born], I lose<a href=#><strong> Taylor [Kinney]</strong></a>. It’s like a turnover.”</p><p><a href=#>Gaga’s pattern appeared to continue</a> less than two years after the documentary was released. Just weeks <a href=#>before she took home the Oscar for Best Original Song,</a> the “Shallow” singer and then-fiancé<a href=#><strong> Christian Carino</strong></a> called it quits.</p><p>“Gaga has been in such a focus on her career right now and has not even had time to address what has been happening between her and Christian, emotionally,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly in February 2019. “She has been telling those around her, ‘Let’s stay focused.’”</p><p>Months after her breakup from Carino, the “Rain on Me” singer stepped out with <a href=#>businessman <strong>Michael Polansky</strong></a> in December 2019. She <a href=#>made their relationship Instagram official</a> in February 2020 by sharing a candid photo of herself sweetly sitting in his lap.</p><p>“We had so much fun in Miami,” she captioned <a href=#>the post</a>. “Love to all my little monsters and fans, you’re the best! ❤️.”</p><p>While discussing her Born This Way Foundation two months later, the New York native <a href=#>referred to her beau as the “love of my life.”</a></p><p>A source told Us exclusively in February 2021 that <a href=#>the duo are “beyond smitten” with each other</a>. “When they’re together, they are always touching, giggling and it’s obvious they really love each other,” the insider said, noting that Polansky is “down-to-earth, smart and focused on his businesses.”</p><p>After starring opposite <a href=#><strong>Bradley Cooper</strong></a> in A Star Is Born in 2018, fans speculated<a href=#> whether the two costars struck up a romantic relationship</a> due to their insane chemistry both on and offscreen.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“People saw love, and guess what? <a href=#>That’s what we wanted you to see,</a>” she told <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong></a> in February 2019 following <a href=#>the pair’s intimate performance of “Shallow” at the Oscars</a>. “I’m an artist, and I guess we did a good job.
