Bye, haters! Teen Mom OG’s Amber Portwood took to Instagram on Monday, October 24, to clap back at internet trolls who criticized her post-plastic surgery breasts.
The 25-year-old reality star faced backlash from body-shamers after she posted a series of videos explaining her side of the physical altercation that occurred between herself and TMOG costar Farrah Abraham at a reunion taping in Los Angeles this past Saturday. In the clips, Portwood puts her newly ample cleavage on display in a low-cut nightgown."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

In the clips, Portwood puts her newly ample cleavage on display in a low-cut nightgown.</p><p>“Everyone shut the f–k up about my boobs. Get off my page,” the <i>Never Too Late</i> author says in the video above. “I’m in my nightgown. Listen to the words coming out of my mouth and let’s be grown women. Bye!”</p><p>In an earlier clip, Portwood, who underwent unspecified plastic surgery to regain her post-baby body three weeks ago, opened up about her cosmetically enhanced assets.</p><p>“I know the boobies are out,” she said, “but they’re hard to manage now that they’ve been lifted, so.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/amber-portwood-matt-baier-f1c60682-b36f-4922-a6b3-2d9fc2cc3cbb.jpg><p>The <i>16 & Pregnant</i> alum — who is mom of Leah, 7, with ex-fiance <b>Gary Shirley</b> — was clearly fired up after her scuffle with Abraham, 25. As <a href=#>previously reported</a>, the fight took place when the ladies were speaking with Dr. <b>Drew Pinsky</b> for the reunion special.</p><p>According to <i><a href=#>Real Mr. Housewife</a></i>, Pinsky questioned Abraham and her on-again, off-again boyfriend, <b>Simon Saran</b>, about comments Saran had recently made about Portwood’s fiance, <b>Matt Baier</b>, when the trouble began. (In several Snapchats, Saran likened Baier — who is more than a decade older than Portwood — to a pedophile while watching episodes of <i>Teen Mom OG</i>.)</p><p>Before Saran could apologize for his hurtful remarks, Abraham interrupted and spewed, “Well, [Baier] does kind of look like a pedophile,” according to the reality TV site.</p><p>Real Mr. Housewife reports that Abraham’s jab caused Portwood to run onstage to defend her man, which prompted the <i>Backdoor Teen Mom</i> star’s father, <b>Michael Abraham</b>, to also hop onstage to defend his daughter.</p><p>Saran later tweeted about the shocking episode, telling fans, “Recap of reunion: @amberportwood trotting around like a hippo. Matt and another senior citizen in a small scuffle. #teenmomog.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>According to Portwood, however, there is more to the story. “I think it’s gonna be kinda sad, though, when the video comes out and, you know, they kinda look like liars,” she told her fans on Instagram. “Well, not kind of. They’re gonna look like nothing but liars. Which makes me kind of excited that the video will be coming out in the reunion.”</p><p>She added: “I will always stick up for my man and I will always stick up for myself.”</p><p><i>Teen Mom OG</i> airs on MTV Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapZKav268zqursKefmXqlscWepZ2rXaW8tMCMrKyrn5Wnxm6uzqiZrGWRnK6qutKtZKKmpJq%2Fr7HTZqurp5yhwG7Dk21tbnFgZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-cory-nastazio-see-net-worth-quote-awards-fact-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Cory Nastazio?
