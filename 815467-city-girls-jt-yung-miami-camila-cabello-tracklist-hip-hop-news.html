The pair reunited after a 3 year gap in new studio albums with RAW. The project sported features from <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Usher</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Durk</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Juicy J</a>, Muni Long, and Kim Petras, but that didn't help it sell copies. The album under-performed commercially leading many to question whether the pair were better off focusing on solo work. Some of that debate sparked from "No Bars" a solo single JT dropped last year which many thought was the best song on their new album. She's continued dropping new solo singles this year with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">her songs "Sideways" and "OKAY. "</a> She also popped up for a memorable guest verse on the Doechii single "Alter Ego."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier this week, fans got more evidence that the pair may be planning to work more as solo artists going forward. The new album from pop singer Camila Cabello s due out later this month, her first since 2022's Familia. She's already dropped singles from the album that features appearances from <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Playboi Carti</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Nas X</a> and now revealed the entire tracklist. That includes the song "Dade County Dreaming" which features both of the City Girls on it. But instead of being listed as "City Girls" they're credited as JT and Yung Miami. The move sparked debate among fans online about the future of the pair's rap project. Check out a post commenting on the debate spawning from Camila's announcement below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-jt-and-yung-miami-s-credits-lead-city-girls-fans-to-debate>JT And Yung Miami's Credits Lead City Girls Fans To Debate</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the comments, fans debate the possible reasons for the pair being listed as separate artists. "Why are yall surprised? ü§î They‚Äôve been pushing their individual identities for YEARS!!!! Rebranding themselves, Dropping hint after hint üò≠" one commenter suggests. "They are probably contractually tied to City Girls but are free to work as ‚Äúindependent artists‚Äù So if they perform under City Girls Quality Control gets paid but if they perform individually they get paid independent" another fan theorizes.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of JT and Yung Miami being listed as separate artists in the tracklist of Camila Cabello's new album?
