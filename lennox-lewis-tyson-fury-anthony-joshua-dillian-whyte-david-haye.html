At least, not to his face anyway.</p><p>On with the countdown...</p><p><strong>10. Herbie Hide (1989-2010)<br></strong>W: 49 (43 KOs), L: 4</p><p>The 6ft 2in ‘Dancing Destroyer’ was unfortunate to be active at the start of the super-heavyweight era as the skilful, sharp-punching, fleet-footed Hide could never match up to the giants. Knocked out Michael Bentt at Millwall’s The Den in 1994 to win the then lightly regarded WBO title. But a step up to elite level came next and, while Hide had no problem hitting Riddick Bowe, he could not take the American’s return fire and was stopped in a brave effort. KO2 by a young Vitali Klitschko in 1999 ended Hide’s top-level aspirations.</p><p><strong>9. Henry Akinwande (1989-2008)<br></strong>W: 50 (30 KOs), L: 4, D: 1</p><p>The London-born ‘Henry the Hugger’ looked the part, with height, an impressive physique and solid fundamentals. Akinwande built up a 32-0-1 record and picked up the WBO belt before earning a shot at true champion Lennox Lewis in 1997. Unfortunately, that is a contender for ugliest ever heavyweight title fight as Akinwande the octopus held, held and held some more, before being disqualified in round five. Remained a sturdy contender for years after that but, understandably, there was little public desire to see him get another world title shot.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Boxing</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/03/A09I7200.jpg><p><strong>8. Dillian Whyte (2011-present)<br></strong>W: 28 (19 KOs), L: 2</p><p>It might seem odd to place ‘<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Bodysnatcher</a>’ above two men who held a heavyweight world title (even if it was only the WBO version). But in beating top contenders such as Joseph Parker, Oscar Rivas and Derek Chisora, Whyte has proved himself a top-five heavyweight in a competitive era. Has improved since his loss to Anthony Joshua and, while the (avenged) KO defeat by Alexander Povetkin was a big setback, it at least came in a fight Whyte was dominating. Tough, rugged with a powerful left hook and has earned his world title shot.</p><p><strong>7. Joe Bugner (1967-1999)<br></strong>W: 69 (43 KOs), L: 13, D: 1</p><p>The physique of a Greek statue, but with fewer moves (copyright: Hugh McIlvanney) was the harsh, humorous take on the Hungary-born Brit. Bugner looked the part and owned a terrific chin, going the distance with Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali (twice). He could box, too, but seemed content to coast in fights. Unpopular after controversially outpointing 37-year-old Henry Cooper in his retirement fight, Bugner eventually cashed in on his panto villain status by returning with Australian citizenship (aged 37 himself) to lose to Frank Bruno in 1987.</p><p><strong>6. Sir Henry Cooper (1954-1971)<br></strong>W: 40 (25 KOs), L: 14, D: 1</p><p>The only British boxer to be knighted, beloved of the public and – if this list was about pound-for-pound gifts – he’d be a few steps higher. Our ’Enry was a small heavyweight even by 1960s standards and had a tendency to cut. However he owned a vicious left hook, ’Enry’s ’Ammer, which famously sat Ali (then Cassius Clay) on his backside at Wembley. Challenging for the world title – in the era of one heavyweight champ – was as close as he got, but Cooper won every other belt up to European level, as well as the hearts of everyone he met.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000677976360.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000680427811.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000650504702.jpg><p><strong>5. Frank Bruno (1982-1996)<br></strong>W: 40 (38 KOs), L: 5</p><p>The only heavyweight who can rival Cooper for public affection, lovable Londoner Bruno was a sculpted adonis with a dangerous right hand and the heart of a lion. He was not, however, a natural boxer and could fall apart when taken into deep waters by foes who were able to take his power. Stopped by Tim Witherspoon, Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis but in 1995 finally won his fourth world title shot, jabbing then wearily grabbing erratic Oliver McCall to defeat. A low-action fight but not one person at an elated Wembley cared. Big Frank had done it at last.</p><p><strong>4. David Haye (2002-2018)<br></strong>W: 28 (26 KOs), L: 4</p><p>Easy to forget, given he was at his best at cruiserweight and his career finished with two losses to Tony Bellew, that for a spell ‘The Hayemaker’ really was a top heavyweight. The lithe, quick, gifted Haye carried his power up, although his best win was outboxing 7ft Nikolai Valuev in Germany. Losing on points to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a peak Wladimir Klitschko</a> was not a shameful result, but the boring fight and toe-injury excuses damaged Haye’s previously booming popularity. Injuries later robbed him of his athleticism but the prime Haye was a dangerous fighter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000673435104.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/09/MDR15416.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000727260913.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000619357151.jpg><p><strong>3. Anthony Joshua (2013-present)<br></strong>W: 24 (22 KOs), L: 2</p><p>Defeats to Andy Ruiz Jr (avenged) and Oleksandr Usyk (TBC) have understandably hit Joshua’s standing. But let’s not forget that for several years, during Tyson Fury’s absence, he was widely viewed as the no.1 heavyweight on the planet – which nobody below him on this list could ever claim. An Olympic gold medallist with an impressive array of power shots, AJ has won a multitude of heavyweight belts while beating Dillian Whyte, Joseph Parker, Alexander Povetkin and Wladimir Klitschko. Only 32, let’s not write him off just yet.</p><p><strong>2. Tyson Fury (2008-present)<br></strong>W: 31 (22 KOs), L: 0, D: 1</p><p>It’s a compliment to Fury that the gap between no.1 and no.2 on this list is closing as he pulls away from the pack (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">providing he overcomes Dillian Whyte on Saturday</a>). A giant, versatile, switch-hitting, endlessly improving one-off, Fury would be a handful for any heavyweight in history. Upset Wladimir Klitschko then, after almost eating and drinking himself into oblivion, returned to give us a thrilling trilogy with Deontay Wilder. Unbeaten in his first 32 pro fights, a victory over Whyte – and then the Usyk-Joshua II winner – cements his all-time greatness.</p><p><strong>1. Lennox Lewis (1989-2003)<br></strong>W: 41 (32 KOs), L: 2, D: 1</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on talkSPORT">Read More on talkSPORT</h2><p>The sheer volume of top-level wins keeps Lewis above Fury. For a man with the total package of size, athleticism, ramrod jab, fluid skills and KO power, Lewis could be frustrating. He sometimes fought down to the level of his opponent and twice paid the ultimate price, with shock KO defeats. But he avenged both losses and also has wins over (deep breath) Razor Ruddock, Andrew Golota, Evander Holyfield, David Tua, Mike Tyson, Vitali Klitschko and more. A three-time world champ, the best heavyweight of his era and one of the greatest ever.</p><p><strong>talkSPORT will bring you live coverage of the huge heavyweight world title fight between&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyson Fury and Dillian Whyte</a>&nbsp;at Wembley on Saturday night, with our coverage starting from 7.30pm and featuring expert ringside analysis from Ben Davison</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifLS8zquraJqfrbavs45qZ3FwaGd%2BcLjEp6WosF2hsri10marsqufo3qnwdGyZJqmpJ28r8WMo6asoKWWeqW1y6WgmqZdrLW6wMRmm5qumZl6qa3YnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steffy-didnt-have-a-night-of-sex-with-bill.html><span>←</span><span>Steffy didn't have a night of sx with Bill - The Bold and the Beautiful</span></a>
