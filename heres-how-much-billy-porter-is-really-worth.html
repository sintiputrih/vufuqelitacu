The star of stage, screen, and the red carpet is worth approximately $4 million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>.&nbsp;Part of that net worth, per the outlet, is undoubtedly due to his numerous Broadway and television appearances.

Apparently, <a href=#>Idina Menzel</a> is slated to play the evil stepmother. Okay, can't wait for this.&nbsp;Real estate-wise, per a 2014 interview with <a href=#>The New York Times</a>, Porter lives in a two-bedroom apartment in Harlem with "floor to ceiling windows" and incredible views, alongside his husband, Adam Smith,&nbsp;who he has been married to since 2017, per <a href=#>Playbill</a>.</p><p>The living arrangement is quite a change for Porter since, per The New York Times, for 13 years, he lived out of "three suitcases, 26 boxes and a chaise lounge." Yup, Porter even made financial hardship glamorous.&nbsp;"It was a really difficult down period. I actually had to file for bankruptcy in 2007," Porter told the outlet. "I bought my chaise lounge before I had a place to live." Well, Porter's chair certainly has a home now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma21gaIN2e8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnMrpqhZZKeua3FjKmmq6yVp3qqv4yrnJqknK56uLvRrZ9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./director-of-gundam-live-action-adaptation-shares-his-thoughts-on-the-film.html><span>←</span><span>Gundam live-action director says Legendary is the only studio capable of making it happen</span></a>
