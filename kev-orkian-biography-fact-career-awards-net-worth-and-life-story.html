He has performed around the world from New York City, Los Angeles and Toronto to Dubai, Oman and Australia. Orkian has been compared to the likes of Victor Borge, Bobby Crush, and Dudley Moore.</p><p>Between 2003 and 2009, Kev Orkian spent a lot of his time touring the UK as the support act for some of the biggest names in British comedy and has previously starred in West-End London musicals including Fame, Happy Days and Boogie Nights alongside Dancing on Ice winner and Emmerdale actress Hayley Tamaddon.</p><p>In 2009 Kev Orkian became a regular on the UK comedy circuit performing at well-known clubs such as Jongleurs where his comedy rendition of Elton John’s I’m Still Standing has been described as Comedy Gold, and has generated standing ovations.</p><p>On 23 September 2009 Event Magazine reported that Kev Orkian won the final of ‘The Next Big Thing’ – the event industry’s version of The X Factor, which was held at Event UK in Birmingham.</p><p>On Thursday 10 June 2010, Kev Orkian performed for HRH The Prince Philip, celebrating his 89th birthday at the Guards Polo Club. The event fell behind schedule and Prince Philip was set to leave – before Kev got on stage – to get to another engagement. But as soon as Kev started his sketch the Prince decided to sit back down and watch the full act. So impressed was he that instead of rushing off at the end he stayed even longer to congratulate Kev in person. Prince Philip was quoted as saying “It’s a wonderful show. I thoroughly enjoyed your performance”.</p><p>Also in June 2010, Kev Orkian performed a live comedy ‘sketch’ with opera diva Katherine Jenkins for a private birthday party at which Motown legend Lionel Richie also performed, along with the NSO (National Symphony Orchestra) and comedians Bobby Davro and Jethro. The comedy routine was an updated version of an old Victor Borge sketch which Kev Orkian had developed with Katherine Jenkins.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=britains-got-talent></span>Britain’s Got Talent<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In May 2010 Kev Orkian took part in series 4 of ITV’s flagship entertainment show Britain’s Got Talent, with his first appearance on Saturday 29 May, the last show of the first round auditions. In this appearance, during which Orkian performed his trademark Elton John scratchy CD version of ‘I’m Still Standing’, he gained three YES votes from Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden and Piers Morgan, the latter of whom commented “That is one of the smartest things I’ve seen”, winning himself a place in the live semi-final on Tuesday 1 June.</p><p>High-street bookmakers Coral reported one of the biggest gambles in reality TV history on piano playing funny man Kev Orkian to win the talent show stating “With the semi-finals of Britain’s Got Talent set to get underway in just a few hours, Coral are reporting one of the biggest gambles in reality TV history on piano playing funny man Kev Orkian to win the talent show. Orkian has been cut from 100/1 to 9/1 with the firm, and he is now the fourth favourite behind Spellbound, who are 2/1 favourites, Olivia Archbold (7/2) and Liam McNally, at 13/2. Coral spokesman Gary Burton told Bettingpro: “The few pounds we saw first thing this morning at 100/1 and 80/1 quickly turned into three figure bets at shorter prices, he will cost us a fortune if he wins. It’s been an incredible punt!””.</p><p>Despite missing out on a place in the Britain’s Got Talent final and losing the chance to perform at the Royal Variety Show, Kev Orkian nevertheless beat winners Spelbound and the other finalists to the post of performing for Royalty. Orkian entertained HRH Prince Philip less than two weeks after being booted off the show and had already performed for several other members of the Royal family including Prince Charles and Princess Michael of Kent. Kev Orkian was invited to perform for Prince Charles at Windsor Castle in 2009 for the British Forces Foundation 10th Gala Dinner. Classical singer Katherine Jenkins and comedian David Walliams also attended. Orkian was granted access to one of the castle’s bedrooms to prepare for the comedy piano sketch and he recalls the moment he turned to see Prince Charles turn bright red with laughter during his act: “I was amazed”. After the sketch, Prince Charles congratulated him and said he was an “absolute genius”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=pantomime></span>Pantomime<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Since 1999 Kev Orkian has starred in the British tradition of Pantomime alongside a plethora of British stars including Leslie Grantham, Julian Clary, husband and wife team Linda Lusardi & Sam Kane, John Inman and Claire Sweeney.</p><p>In December 2009 he starred as Chester The Jester in Sleeping Beauty alongside singer/actress Claire Sweeney at The Churchill Theatre, Bromley.</p><p>2010 was the first year for over a decade that Kev Orkian did not perform in panto, deciding to concentrate on private bookings and presenting his own full one-man show.</p><p>2011 sees Kev Orkian perform in the biggest Pantomime in the UK alongside comedy legend Dame Edna Everage at the wimbledon theatre for FFE productions.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=edinburgh-fringe-festival></span>Edinburgh Fringe Festival<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2010></span>2010<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In August 2010 Kev Orkian made his debut appearance at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, taking his full one-man show, ‘Kev Orkian – The Illegal Tour’, to the Underbelly on Cowgate.</p><p>Trystan Davies, of Fringe Guru awarded the show five stars, stating “Kev Orkian is an acknowledged rising star, and has been rightfully compared to Victor Borge and Dudley Moore.” Liz, of LoveFringe.com, also awarded the show a full score of five stars, saying: “This show is one of the few which had us laughing all the way through and received a standing ovation, which is rare for Fringe shows.”</p><p>The show received similar reviews from the British comedy guide, awarding the show four and a half out of five; and ThreeWeeks magazine, who gave it four out of five stars.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=current></span>Current<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2013></span>2013<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kev Orkian booked an arena tour in South Africa in April performing to 6000 people per night, followed by a tour of the Middle East in late April.
