<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Myla Pablo Wiki: Is She Dating Patrick Aquino? Boyfriend, Family And Ethnicity</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The issue of Myla Pablo’s boyfriend has been much discussed; people are curious about volleyball players’ personal details. Myla Pablo is a volleyball professional. She was born in Tarlac City, Philippines, and began playing volleyball in high school. After graduating from high school, Pablo later played for the National University (NU) Lady Bulldogs in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP). Pablo has won several trophies and accolades during her career, including Best Spiker in the UAAP Season 75 in 2007, Best Spiker in the Shakeys V-League Season 10 in 2013, and many more.</p><p>She is one of the best volleyball players in the nation, and she has a large number of fans who are interested in knowing about her personal life.</p><h2>Is Myla Pablo’s boyfriend Patrick Aquino still with her?</h2><p>Patrick Aquino, Myla Pablo’s boyfriend, is a basketball coach, and they met between 2014 and 2018.&nbsp;They hadn’t disclosed the exact date they began dating, but they initially met while her lover Patrick was a coach on the Women’s Basketball team.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Myla-Pablo-1.jpg alt="Myla Pablo" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to numerous accounts, Pablo and Aquino had been dating for more than five years in 2019. They have not, however, been married or engaged.&nbsp;The pair does not seem to be together anymore, and no images of them have been uploaded on social media. You may also discover rare images of them on the Internet. They have not publicly declared their separation and have not discussed their relationship, therefore extremely ambiguous information has been revealed in public.&nbsp;Pablo and Aquino are about 20 years apart in age; the professional player is 29, while the coach is 47.</p><p>For a while after making their relationship public, they received numerous nasty remarks regarding their age difference. To emphasize their present connection, the couple’s social media account contains no images of them together. As a result, we may assume that they have been separated.</p><h2>Myla Pablo’s Parents And Family&nbsp;Ethnicity</h2><p>Myla Pablo was born in Tarlac, Philippines to Filipino parents, hence she is of Filipino descent and of White ethnicity. The athlete has kept her personal life private from the media, and she has never publicly acknowledged the ethnicity of her family.&nbsp;And it’s always in her best interests to keep it quiet. Her faith, like her nationality, has been kept hidden.</p><p>Moving on to Pablo’s parents, she has a close bond with her mother and often posts images with her on Instagram. Pablo has lost her father, but there are photos of him on the Internet.&nbsp;The pro volleyball player recently tweeted photos of her mum wishing her a happy birthday. Her mother has always been a strong supporter of her professional decision and used to attend her game days.&nbsp;Pablo has a very tight connection with her mother, and following her images on Instagram demonstrates this.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Myla-Pablo.jpg alt="Myla Pablo" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Myla Pablo’s Net Worth in 2023</h2><p>According to the source, Pablo’s net worth is often discussed on the Internet; her net worth is said to be between $5 million and $10 million.&nbsp;Her base wage in the firm F2 Logistics Cargo Movers has not been made public, but we may estimate it to be approximately $500 thousand.</p><p>Pablo has not officially disclosed her net worth or professional earnings, thus it is unknown.&nbsp;Pablo’s principal source of income is her professional volleyball career, although she may have additional sources of income, like business and investments, which she has not disclosed publicly.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiksqSRYr2irsuoZLChm556qr%2BMrJ%2BeZZSWwaq6xmanmqyinrCsecCqrKKmn2KvsMXFq6CeppRis6K5yKWwZpmemXqmwMenoJyhpK58</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./njum-khan.html><span>←</span><span>Anjum Khan Biography, Husband, Age, Height, Net Worth, Career</span></a>
