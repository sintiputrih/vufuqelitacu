It’s good at being what it is, but what it is is ‘Awkwafina and Daveed Diggs doing Hamilton rap in the middle of The Little Mermaid.’ It feels like the brainchild of some executive who can’t stop won’t stop doing “Guns and Ships” at office parties.”</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>That’s not really the response you want from the soundtrack of a big budget Disney remake film. I get that on paper it seems like a good idea, and that Miranda has hit home runs for Disney before, with “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” being one of the best examples.</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>In my opinion and that of many others, this song is trash though. Awkwafina’s voice sounds like nails on a symphony of chalkboards. They use this song to torture dissidents in countries where Dictators rule. I’d rather get my teeth drilled without anesthesia than listen to the abomination that is this woman’s voice.</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>Look, Awkwafina is very funny and obviously incredibly talented. But you wouldn’t ask LeBron James to do your taxes. That’s not his strength! Why were we subjected to this nightmare of a monstrosity. God save us all.
