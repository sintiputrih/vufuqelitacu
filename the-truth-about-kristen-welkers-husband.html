Per <a href=#>The New York Times</a>, in October 2014, her best friend had set her up with a man who she thought was a good match.&nbsp;</p><p>Welker stepped out of the cab at the restaurant where they were meeting and was surprised to see Hughes waiting for her outside the eatery. He was wearing a blazer, and Welker recalled thinking, "It was just about the most chivalrous thing a man can do." He was off to an impressive start. As for Hughes, he thought that Welker was "out of my league." He continued, "I remember thinking to myself, 'If I can just make her laugh, maybe I'll have a chance.'"&nbsp;</p><p>His tactic worked, and he scored a second date where he handed her an envelope, saying, "I&nbsp;made you something." The Merck marketing director had made Welker a presidential trivial crossword puzzle with handwritten clues. "That's the moment he got me," she said. "As a White House correspondent, it was so touching, and it marked him different than anyone else I ever dated," Welker stated.&nbsp;</p><p>Six months later, he popped the question at the Lincoln Memorial. Hughes divulged, "I wanted to ask her outside in a place you could walk by years later and tell your kids that this was the spot we got engaged." Isn't that the most romantic story ever? Hughes is definitely going to be a one-of-a-kind father, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWtmbIZze9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2gv6q%2F056lZq%2BVobimvtJmn66rkpa7pXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robert-costa-journalist.html><span>←</span><span>Robert Costa Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</span></a>
