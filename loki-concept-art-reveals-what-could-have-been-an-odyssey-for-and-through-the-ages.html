As viewers know, Loki also introduced the Time Variance Authority, and in turn further expanded on the MCU’s time travel rules. And while we did get quite a bit of such shenanigans over the course of the show, some early set photos indicate that they didn’t quite go as all-out as they were originally planning to.</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>With <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s Loki: The Art of the Series</a> having released earlier today, the more bookish side of Marvel’s fanbase was treated to some delectable behind-the-scenes photographs (via <a href=#>The Direct</a>), many of which depicted Loki in several distinct historical settings, including but not limited to the Old West, feudal Japan, and ancient Egypt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/loki9.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Loki-concept-art-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Loki-concept-art.jpg><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>It’s perhaps disheartening to know that we missed out on a historical epic of cosmic proportions with Loki himself at the center of it all. But season two of Loki gearing up for a mid-2023 release with its plot details still under wraps<strong> </strong>does give hope to the possibility that the inclusion of this epic arc is still on the table.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ytu8qiZJynnpiyscCMmqmtZaKaw6aty6xksKCRqXqku9Slm2agkauybq7EnqVmmZ5ivKXF0qycsmWWpL9urc2dZK2goqTCqLSMrZ%2BeZZGcsrR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miami-heat-chances.html><span>←</span><span>Miami Heat Chances Of Winning Finals [NBA Finals Odds]</span></a>
