Attendees at the ultra-private ceremony included <a href=#><strong>Anne Hathaway</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Emily Blunt</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Édgar Ramírez</strong></a>, all of whom have starred in movies with Chastain.</p><p>Passi de Preposulo has <a href=#>worked as an executive at the fashion brand</a> Moncler, but he comes from one of the oldest noble families in Italy. The country no longer recognizes the aristocracy, but his family still uses their titles — and he’s a count. He previously worked as a publicist for Armani, and he counts <strong>Giorgio Armani</strong>‘s niece <strong>Roberta Armani</strong> as one of his mentors.</p><p>In 2010, he founded Fiol, his own brand of prosecco, with two childhood friends. “We grew up surrounded by prosecco,” he told <a href=#>Business Insider</a> in June 2018, adding that he first tasted the bubbly drink when he was 9 or 10 years old. “The harvest was a very specific time of year for us.”</p><p>Chastain is also a fan of the Passi de Preposulo family home, thanks in part to the availability of delicious drinks. “There’s a lot of wine and food,” she told <a href=#><strong>Kelly Ripa</strong></a> in 2017. “It’s beautiful there.”</p><p>The Interstellar star doesn’t often discuss her husband in interviews, but he occasionally accompanies her to awards shows and film premieres. He sometimes pops up on her Instagram feed as well, as he did in November 2021 when she wished him happy birthday. “What a man! 😍,” she wrote at the time. “Happy Birthday to my hubby @preposulo! Excited to celebrate you today.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Juilliard School graduate also gave fans a glimpse of her love on Valentine’s Day 2017, sharing a photo of the duo enjoying a glass of wine several months before their wedding. “💖Some things are worth the wait💖 @preposulo #happyvalentinesday,” she captioned the sweet snap.</p><p>Keep scrolling for a look back at Chastain and Passi de Preposulo’s relationship timeline.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt6a%2F0qKammWTna60wMCipWagpaivorrDZp6imZ5iubavwKxkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXam2rrHLoqWeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cartel-allegedly-seeks-ransom-after-tennessee-fugitive-found-dead-in-mexico-crime-online.html><span>←</span><span>Cartel Allegedly Seeks Ransom After Tennessee Fugitive Found Dead in Mexico Crime Online</span></a>
