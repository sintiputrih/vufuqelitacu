In the desert they're hanging Christmas lights
From a cactus Christmas tree
And all the way over the sea
In Tokyo, they're hanging mistletoe
And way down south in Mexico
They're singing feliz Navidad

And why is he so obsessed with Ali DiLaurentis and her friends?</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Here's What Everyone Forgets About Britney Spears' Rise To Fame</h2><time>Apr 6, 2024</time>

As the Doctor changes so much with each regeneration, the costume worn by the different versions of the Time Lord says a lot about their personality, so there‚Äôs often much excitement and interest in what they‚Äôll be wearing every time the next&nbsp;Doctor Who&nbsp;lead‚Äôs announced.
