Joe Burrow is the quarterback for the Cincinnati Bengals in the NFL. His college football career began in 2015 at Ohio State University. Joe red-shirted his first season, and then served as the back-up quarterback in the 2016 and 2017 seasons. In May 2018, he officially transferred to Louisiana State University after finding out he would not be Ohio State’s starter.
Most of Joe’s first season at LSU was plagued by injury, but he dominated as the team’s starting QB in 2019."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
