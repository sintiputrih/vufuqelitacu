Getting pimples as an adult brings a new sort of frustration to skincare, and it can be difficult to know how to approach zits without immediately reverting to High School You and poking, pinching and prodding it in an effort to get rid of the unsightly acne until it’s an even worse mess than you started with.

Ideally, you can stick it on, get some sleep and wake up with clearer looking skin — but it’ll work at any time of day, with visible results in under eight hours. Each patch absorbs the gross gunk in pimples responsible for their icky, red-or-white-headed appearances and painful, bothersome sensations. How do they do it? It’s all about the medical-grade hydrocolloid, which has particles to draw out and absorb junk from blemishes and then form a hydrated gel over the lesion — creating a moist environment to promote healing and protect new tissue. It’s all super-scientific, and all you need to do is peel, stick, wait and watch in wonder!</p><p>They’re also great for preventing further irritation from making acne worse, protecting them from the elements&nbsp;and nervous picking fingers.

I really wasn’t sure about how to treat it other than applying tea tree oil. Someone recommended pimple patches so I got these. First photo is the day before I got the patches. Second photo is after using the patches two days in a row. I was shocked at how well they actually worked, and thankful that it did!
