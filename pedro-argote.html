Judge Wilkinson was shot in the driveway of his home in the 19100 block of Olde Waterford Road, just north of Hagerstown, Maryland.</p><p>What makes this tragedy even more heart-wrenching is that Judge Wilkinson’s wife and son were inside the house when the shooting happened.

They rushed him to Meritus Medical Center in Hagerstown, but despite their desperate efforts, he did not survive.</p><p>In a press conference, authorities revealed that they are actively investigating the incident.

It’s reported that Wilkinson presided over a hearing on the morning of October 19, 2023, specifically regarding a partial judgment of absolute divorce. Interestingly, Argote was notably absent from that hearing.</p><p>However, the attack is believed to be a reaction to the custody decision favoring the mother of Argote’s children. According to court documents, the judgment for absolute divorce was granted to the wife due to Argote’s cruel treatment and irreconcilable differences.</p><p>In addition to the divorce, sole custody of their four children was awarded to the wife. Furthermore, it was ruled that Pedro could not initiate contact with the children or his wife unless she consented, and he could only do so to retrieve a 2009 Mercedes – which happens to be the same vehicle that the sheriff’s office believes he may be using.</p><p>The court also granted the wife exclusive use and possession of their family home and imposed restrictions on Argote from entering that residence. Additionally, he was ordered to pay $1,120 per month in child support.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Pedro Argote wife and kids" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Pedro-Argote-wife-and-kids.webp alt="Pedro Argote wife and kids" width=400 height=257 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Pedro Argote Family Background</strong></h2><p>Pedro Argote was born on November 24, 1973&nbsp;in Washington, America. According to available information, he has made his home in Frederick since his marriage. A glimpse into court records reveals that there was a significant incident in June 2022 when Argote’s wife filed a domestic violence petition against him.</p><p>However, this petition was dismissed in less than two weeks. In her petition, Argote’s wife detailed concerns about physical abuse against one of their daughters, a feeling of insecurity due to his possession of a weapon, and apprehensions about his potential intent to take their children away from her.</p><p>She noted that Argote owned a minimum of two firearms. She further described how he would subject her to harassment through texts and emails, employ home security cameras to keep an eye on her, and exercise emotional and financial control. The local sheriff confirmed that Argote possessed a legally registered handgun.</p><h3><strong>Pedro Argote FAQs</strong></h3><p>Ques: How old is Pedro Argote?</p><p>Ans: Pedro is 49 years old.</p><p>Ques: How tall is Pedro Argote?</p><p>Ans: 5 feet 7 inches.</p><p>Ques: Who killed Judge Andrew F.
