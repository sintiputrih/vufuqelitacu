It was discovered near Montilla, Spain, which could mean that the famous Battle of Munda, in which Caesar’s forces conquered the armies of the sons of Pompey, was fought here.</p><p>The Battle of Munda, fought in 45 B.C.E., was a decisive victory for Caesar. The sons of Pompey, upset with Caesar’s increasingly dictatorial rule, rebelled against the Roman leader, sparking a civil war. The Battle of Munda put an end to that war — but for years, historians debated where, exactly, the battle was fought. Montilla has come up quite a few times in the discussion, but the discovery of this lead sling bullet provides more concrete evidence for this theory.</p><p>Fascinatingly, the Battle of Munda took place just one year before Caesar’s assassination — almost to the day. The Battle of Munda was fought on March 17, 45 B.C.E., and Caesar was assassinated on March 15, 44 B.C.E. at the Senate House in Rome.</p><p>Meanwhile, there were also several important historical anniversaries this month, including the <a href=# rel=noopener>assault on Nancy Kerrigan</a> on January 6, 1994, the Treaty of Paris on January 14, 1784, the <a href=# rel=noopener>“Miracle on the Hudson”</a> on January 15, 2009, the death of <a href=# rel=noopener>Chang and Eng Bunker</a> on January 17, 1874, and the official release of the original Apple Macintosh on January 22, 1984.</p><p class=.post-content>Learn more about the <a href=#>music</a> used in our podcast.
