Is he in good health in 2023? Here’s what we found.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What is Morgan Freeman’s health status in 2023?</h2><p>When Morgan was 71, he suffered a life-altering accident.</p><p>In 2008, The Shawshank Redemption star’s car flipped and rolled while driving, prompting emergency medical technicians to pry him out of the vehicle using the jaws of life. The actor suffered multiple broken bones from the car wreck and was airlifted to a Memphis hospital for a four-and-a-half-hour surgery.</p><p>After the accident, the Academy Award winner’s left hand experienced severe nerve damage, rendering it virtually useless. And in his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2012 Esquire profile</a>, journalist Tom Chiarella noticed that Morgan still suffered agonizing pain four years later.</p><p>“Every so often he grabs his left shoulder and winces,” Tom wrote. “It hurts when he walks, when he sits still, when he rises from his couch, and when he missteps in a damp meadow. More than hurts. It seems a kind of agony, though he never mentions it.”</p><p>According to the Million Dollar Baby star, there was a specific reason for his pain. "It's the fibromyalgia," Morgan revealed. "Up and down the arm. That's where it gets so bad. Excruciating."</p><p>And he’s still battling the medical condition today.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Fibromyalgia consistently impacts Morgan Freeman’s health. It’s the reason why he’s spotted wearing a glove.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>If you’ve ever wondered why Morgan constantly sports a glove on his left hand, fibromyalgia is to blame. The Dark Knight star donned a compression glove following his gruesome car accident to help prevent blood from accumulating in his damaged appendage.</p><p>Although it has been 15 years since the jaws of life extracted the 85-year-old actor from his vehicle, he still wears the accessory to prevent complications. From the <a href=#>2022 World Cup</a> to the <a href=#>2023 Academy Awards</a>, Morgan’s fibromyalgia flare-ups haven’t slowed since the devastating accident.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Morgan Freeman isn’t the only celebrity suffering from the health condition.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>From <a href=#>Lady Gaga</a> to Sinéad O'Connor to Mary McDonough, other artists and actors also experience the excruciating effects of fibromyalgia. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hot Press</a>, Sinéad opened up about her experience with her medical diagnosis.</p><p>"Fibromyalgia is not curable. But it's manageable,” the “Nothing Compares 2 U” singer shared. "I have a high pain threshold, so that helps — it's the tiredness part that I have difficulty with.”</p><p>Lady Gaga also shared her thoughts. "I get so irritated with people who don’t believe fibromyalgia is real," the House of Gucci actor told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a>.</p><p>"For me, and I think for many others, it’s really a cyclone of anxiety, depression, PTSD, trauma, and panic disorder, all of which sends the nervous system into overdrive, and then you have nerve pain as a result."</p><p>However, these artists — Morgan included — refuse to let fibromyalgia ruin their lives. “I only get one life, and I will not let fibromyalgia take the joy from living it," the legendary actor reportedly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>.</p><p>A Good Person is now playing in theaters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforyzs8CnZJ%2BqlZq6orqMoZyapKSd</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./today-in-history.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened On October 14th</span></a>
