They continued to date for two more years before they <a href=#>broke up in 2019</a>.</p><p>“We were together and trying to do the right thing. And that grief turned into a hope for a love that maybe could replace what we lost,” the lawyer shared with CBS’s <strong>Tracy Smith</strong>. “Well, I made a lot of decisions that I probably shouldn’t have made. There was a lot more compassion and understanding from the people that knew me. But it was a horrible time, too.”</p><p><strong>Joe Biden</strong>, 78, released a statement at the time. “We are all lucky that Hunter and Hallie found each other as they were putting their lives together again after such sadness,” he said in 2017. “They have mine and [my wife] <strong><a href=#>Jill</a></strong> [<a href=#><strong>Biden</strong></a>]’s full and complete support and we are happy for them.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hunter-Biden-Discusses-His-Past-Relationship-with-Late-Brother-Beaus-Widow-Inline.jpg><p>The following year, Hunter told Vanity Fair that the former senator had “always remained proud” of him. “He has been a constant source of love and strength in my life,” the Georgetown University grad gushed of Joe in January 2019.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hunter was previously <a href=#>married to <strong>Kathleen Biden</strong></a> from 1993 to 2017, and the exes share daughters Naomi, 26, Finnegan, 21, and Maisy, 20.
