Like other vultures, the king vulture is a scavenger. Gliding on air currents to conserve energy, they look out below for carcasses to feast on.</p><p>This scavenging fills a vital ecological purpose — curbing the spread of disease by removing rotten remains. Though their white and black tails and wingtips resemble those of other vultures, this creature is otherwise rather striking.</p><i class="fa fa-times"></i> <span class=caption-body>These birds have an odd-looking and fleshy wattle called a "caruncle" right above their nostrils.

Similar to the Dracula parrot, king vultures are bald. This helps the bird stay clean and free of a bacterial infection otherwise festering on their heads.</p><p>King vultures are some of the largest scavengers in the world and have hooked beaks that perfectly evolved to let them rip through gamey carcasses. Smaller birds are well aware to make way once a king vulture arrives, and make sure to give them space enough to feast.</p><p>In terms of reproductive habits, these avians nest on the ground with females laying a single egg that both parents incubate. The shared responsibility continues during an offspring's fledgling period, with both parents bringing back food whenever they find some.</p><p>Fortunately for this species, which dwells in the forested lowlands from southern Mexico to southern Argentina, their status on the International Union for Conservation of Nature is listed as "Least Concern."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony0r8CrsGaamaextHuV</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-brett-favres-net-worth-in-2024.html><span>←</span><span>What is Brett Favre's Net Worth in 2024</span></a>
