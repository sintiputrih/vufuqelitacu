Drew McIntyre and Judgment Day lost that big match, and then CM Punk returned to steal the spotlight in a big way.</p><p><a href=#>Ringside News</a>&nbsp;has complete coverage of the entire Survivor Series event. There are ton of headlines for the show, but&nbsp;<a href=#>we have compiled them all in one place for you</a>.</p><p><a href=#>PW Insider</a> has reported that CM Punk officially signed with WWE today. The deal between both sides reportedly came together over the last week during their initial communications. The contract is described as “several years in length,” indicating it’s a multi-year agreement. While Punk’s schedule details remain unknown, he is expected to wrestle under his new talent contract.</p><p>There were discussions about delaying CM Punk’s return until the Royal Rumble in January 2024 in St. Petersburg, Florida. However, sources suggested that waiting could have led to leaks within WWE about their plans.</p><p>The company rushed CM Punk’s return, allowing him to only drive about 20 minutes from his home to the Allstate Arena, a venue with significant historical significance for him. CM Punk has made a lot of history in the Allstate Arena, and Survivor Series gave him a new moment.</p><p>This marked CM Punk’s first WWE appearance since the Royal Rumble in January 2014, excluding his appearances on WWE Backstage on FOX Sports. Interestingly, TNT Sports released a “CM Punk Is #WWE” graphic, reminiscent of the “#AllElite” graphics used for new talent signings in AEW.</p><p><a href=#>While there were rumors circulating about CM Punk’s potential return</a>, it was confirmed that Randy Orton was making his comeback. Nevertheless, the <a href=#>Second City Savior made an unexpected return</a>. WWE seemed prepared for it, as <a href=#>Punk has introduced new merchandise</a>.</p><p>We will have to see what is going to happen next in this situation. You never know what is going to happen next, as they proved tonight in Chicago.
