In 1993, they released their first album under the name “Faces of Death” but it was not well known.</p><p>The group changed their name to become Bone Thugs-N-Harmony – <a href=#>Krayzie Bone</a> decided that the group needed a godfather, someone who could give a push to the Bone Thugs. He chose the rapper <a href=#>Eazy-E</a>, the leader of the biggest rap group of that time, N.W.A. In 1993, <a href=#>Eazy-E</a> was in Los Angeles doing shows, and The Bones went there, hoping to talk to <a href=#>Eazy-E</a>. Not have achieved such a meeting, but managing to talk to him on the phone, <a href=#>Krayzie Bone</a>, at the request of <a href=#>Eazy-E</a> sang a verse by phone, <a href=#>Eazy-E</a> was impressed with the talent, but not until <a href=#>Eazy-E</a> was doing a show in Cleveland that the Bone Thugs returned to his hometown, and this time could not let the chance escape. They succeeded, made the deal and signed to a Ruthless Records group label that belonged to <a href=#>Eazy-E</a>.</p><p>The Bone Thugs went to Los Angeles to record their new album funded by <a href=#>Eazy-E</a> called “Creepin on ah Come Up” (1994).

The following year the album “Thug Stories” was released by the record label Koch Records.
