That means with the success of a five-game winning streak, a family that dominates the Fast Money round could lead to a prize of $100,000 (per the <a href=#>"Family Feud"</a> website). As if 20 seconds of random survey prompts in front of an audience and the thought of being on television wasn't stressful enough!</p><p>Unable to hit that 200 point-marker?
