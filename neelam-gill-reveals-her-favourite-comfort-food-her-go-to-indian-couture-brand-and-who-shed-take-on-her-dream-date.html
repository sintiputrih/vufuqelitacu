Fashion's June cover star, Neelam Gill, never thought she’d get the shot at modelling for Burberry, “I actually declined at first. I thought, I can't afford the travel and they're never going to want me,” she told Hello! Fashion, “It was Burberry, Kate Moss models for them - and look at all the icons that have modelled for the brand, why would they want me?”</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=e-8o0SrcI9W data-wc=30>Of course the rest is history and at the age of 18 she became the first model of Indian origin to appear in a campaign for the British heritage brand.&nbsp;</p><p id=egGAxZNniHV data-wc=15><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Leonie Hanne on how she made it as an Influencer in a "saturated" market</a></strong></p><p id=eTNLdroQs6Q data-wc=21><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>“I wanted to be more in control and more grounded” Kate Moss on transforming from party girl to wellness guru</a></p><p id=e3n5Hp9PDG8 data-wc=106>It was also the start of her stellar career. Looking back on her career, she says it’s strange how essentially, a big chunk of her life is documented. “I look at pictures of myself and I can remember exactly that moment. How I felt, what I did that day - you can give me a picture of myself anywhere and I could tell you.” And she certainly members what she was thinking on her first shoot for Burberry. “Oh God, I remember… I knew, after he took his first picture…my life was going to change, I just knew it. And it's true everything after that changed.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0c341db85b10-001hfmjune23trimhr-1.jpg><p>NEELAM GILL X HELLO!

Well it starts with her favourite comfort food in either the Maldives or St. Barths, “Breakfast would actually not be that glamorous, but it's very tasty,” Neelam tells us during her Hello! Fashion cover shoot, “It's called a paratha and you can have it with filling in it, like you can have it with potato, or you can have it plain.”</p><p id=eoAIJZMwxbh data-wc=34>For lunch however she’d jet over to India, “Because I'm spoilt for choice I'd wanna visit Rajasthan…. I'd wanna pop through and just roam around and be immersed in all like the beautiful architecture.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c1761de87125-20230317helloneelam060723.jpg><p id=eVwi1PRtWFg data-wc=9>Sounds like the dream day if you ask us.&nbsp;</p><p id=eO-kg3lyxC8 data-wc=21><strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue5Nya25taWS7prHLmqRmn5mhuW6%2BxK%2BcmqSjYrWmvoyfmK%2Bnpae2tbGMnKamnp%2BnwW6yzqibZqCVp3qou4ytpmahnpm2orqMnKaurKWnsm6u0ZqlnWWRo7Fuw8eoZKyglZl6ta3KnmSopl2dsrN5w6ucmqVdma61sY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marvel-just-threw-wolverine-under-the-bus-on-the-eve-of-his-grand-mcu-debut-in-deadpool-3.html><span>←</span><span>Marvel just threw Wolverine under the bus on the eve of his grand MCU debut in Deadpool 3</span></a>
