“Taylor has moved on and is not looking back,” a source exclusively tells Us Weekly of Swift, 34. “The song is her final word.”
The insider adds that Swift “has not heard” from Kardashian, 43, about the track, which appears on Swift’s new album, The Tortured Poets Department.
Swift wasn’t exactly subtle when she wrote the track, capitalizing the letters K, I and M in the title."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

As Swift later pointed out, however, the exact lyric was not mentioned.</p><p>The full phone call eventually leaked, leading to a back-and-forth between the two about what the call did and did not say.</p><p>Swift later detailed to TIME the psychological toll that the feud took on her.</p><p>“You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar,” she said. “That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before. I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year. I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/%E2%80%98thanK-you-aIMee-Is-Taylor-Swifts-%E2%80%98Final-Word-for-Kim-Kardashian-Source-1.jpg><p>But, if “thanK you aIMee” is to be taken at face value, Swift came out of the feud as a stronger person.</p><p>“I built a legacy which you can’t undo,” Swift sings. “But when I count the scars, there’s a moment of truth / That there wouldn’t be this, if there hadn’t been you.”</p><p>She alters the chorus in the final verse from “f–k you, Aimee” to “thank you, Aimee,” singing, “And our town, it looks so small, from way up here / Screamed ‘Thank you, Aimee’ to the night sky / And the stars are stunning / Cause I can’t forget the way you made me heal.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6yjYsGprc2kZLKnpWKuqrnEnmSiq12btq%2Bty2auqKqUYrOwvoykoKZlm5a%2Fpa3SoaCapl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ryan-dawkins-wiki-age-wife-ethnicity-net-worth-height-career.html><span>←</span><span>Ryan Dawkins | Wiki, Age, Wife, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Height, Career</span></a>
