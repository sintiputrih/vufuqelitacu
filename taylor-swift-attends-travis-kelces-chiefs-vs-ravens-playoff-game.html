During the Bills game in Orchard Park, New York, Swift was spotted hanging out with Travis’ older brother, <strong>Jason Kelce</strong>, and Jason’s wife, <strong>Kylie Kelce</strong>, for the first time. Swift and Jason, 36, <a href=#>high-fived and hugged</a> during key moments that led the Chiefs to victory, and he even jumped down into the stands from their private suite to <a href=#>show her a young fan’s sign</a> at one point.</p><p>After Jason made headlines for taking off his shirt, Travis revealed <a href=#>Swift’s reaction to Jason’s antics</a>. “Tay said she absolutely loved you,” he shared during the Wednesday, January 24, episode of the siblings’ “New Heights” podcast.</p><p>While Swift did not mind, Kylie, 31, was less than thrilled with Jason’s enthusiastic display. “I don’t think [Kylie] was happy about it, to be honest with you,” Jason said, noting that he gave her “a heads-up” about his plans to enjoy the game to the fullest. “The moment we got into the suite, I said, ‘I’m taking my shirt off and I’m jumping out of the suite.’ And she said, ‘Jason, don’t you dare.’ I’m not asking for permission, I’m doing this.”</p><p>Jason noted that Kylie had urged him to be on his “best behavior” around Swift. “I was like, ‘Kylie, the first day I met you I was blacked out drunk and fell asleep at a bar,’” he quipped. “This is part of the Jason Kelce charm. I want to make my best first impression, this is my best chance. Set that bar nice and low.”</p><p>Travis, for his part, was on cloud nine about <a href=#>Swift forging a bond with his family</a>. “Everybody knows how close Travis is with his family,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly after the game. “So it really means everything to him how seamlessly Taylor blends in with all of them. … His family is all about just hanging out, joking, and having a great time. It’s almost like she’s known his family forever, and he loves that about her.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Aside from Swift’s interactions with Travis’ loved ones, fans rejoiced when he <a href=#>held up her signature heart-hands</a> symbol after scoring a touchdown during the Chiefs vs. Bills game. Travis explained on the podcast that the gesture was directed at Bills fans who acted “a little disrespectful” toward the Chiefs and Swift.</p><p>“I’m not going to relay it, but some things were said about the family. Some pretty inappropriate things were said about [quarterback Patrick] Mahomes,” he noted. “It was pretty wack.”</p><p>Travis said that he “wanted to make sure [they] knew it wasn’t mutual,” adding, “I don’t hate you guys like you hate us. It’s all love, baby.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWRqcGmusOsZK2qkau2tHnKnqOcnaNisKm1xJ%2BqZq6jYr%2BiwsSnqmaonJbGsLLFZp6apZVk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shawn-rhoden-bio-height-net-worth-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Shawn Rhoden- Bio, Height, Net Worth, Wife</span></a>
