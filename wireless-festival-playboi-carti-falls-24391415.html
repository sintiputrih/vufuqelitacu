The 25-year-old mumble rapper was in midflow when he plummet off the stage with many in the crowd capturing video of the moment.</p><p>The hip-hop artist is shown bouncing backwards down <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>the stage’s walkway</a> to a platform in the middle of the crowd before failing to stop when he reached the edge. The fall drew screams from the crowd, but he was back on his feet in moments, turning what could have been a dangerous incident into a chance to perform amongst the crowd.</p><p>A number of videos of the rapper’s descent were posted to Twitter with many fans reacting to what had happened. In one video, only the fall is captured leaving fans worried about the <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Playboi’s condition</a> afterwards.</p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Disabled fan 'carried on sister's back' and 'forced to watch from distance' due to Wireless Festival's poor accessibility</a></b></p><p>“Is he alive??? Yikes that was a hell of a drop,” asked one concerned fan however others were quick to respond with a video showing the performer continuing the show. When fans knew he was ok many joked about the way he had fallen, straight down, making the fall look cartoonish.</p><p>Many compared it to Wile E Coyote falling off a cliffside while another person said “That dude just Mario pipe teleported into world 3.”</p><p>For some fans, the fall seemed to only make them appreciate the rapper more, as his recovery was fairly smooth. One wrote, “he may fall of the stage but he’ll never fall off as an artist.”</p><p>Others called him the GOAT or the greatest of all time. Some commenters claimed that if they had been there they would have caught him.</p><p>Wireless Festival was in Crystal Palace last weekend and is set to have a stage at Finsbury Park from July 8 - July 10. The lineup includes rap superstars like Cardi B, Sza, and Nicki Minaj - hopefully, none of them will follow in Playboi Carti’s footsteps.</p><p><b>Have a story you think we should be covering?
