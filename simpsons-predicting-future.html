Now maybe you can just chalk it up to humanity being predictably ridiculous, or the fact that the show's been around forever, so the writers are bound to cover everything that's going to happen in the scope of past, present, and future history, but there are some seriously impressive social phenomenons that the show's got right on the nose."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Autocorrect frustrations.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: 20th Century Fox</span></figure><p>S6E19: "Lisa's Wedding" came out way back in 1995. In the episode, Lisa and Marge talk with a phone that has video capabilities and lo and behold, an annoying autocorrect feature. Sound familiar?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. Broken voter machine.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: 20th Century Fox</span></figure><p>S20E4: "Treehouse of Horror XIX" came out in 2008.

Ringo taking 20 years to write back to his fans.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: 20th Century Fox</span></figure><p>S2E18: "Brush with Greatness" had Ringo say he'll write back to each and every one of his fans, even if takes him "20 years".

Or maybe there's a secret organization that's forcing them to deliver their message in cartoon-joke form, so no one takes it seriously? Illuminati.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">24.

Three days later, Homer wakes up in the hospital from a coma.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, people quickly compared this episode to the Titanic submersible incident in 2023. It was initially believed that the pilot and passengers were slowly running out of air after something went wrong on their dive to the wreck of the Titanic. However, it is now believed that the submersible imploded, killing all those onboard instantly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLauvNKopaxloKeypbXCraCnn12bwrXB0Z4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./utah-jazz-basketball-player-gets-haircut-becomes-hot-w201980.html><span>←</span><span>Utah Jazz Basketball Player Gets Haircut, Becomes Hot</span></a>
