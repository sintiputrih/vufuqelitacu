The video is no longer up but plenty of people got screenshots. He doesn't mind teasing his fans about revealing his face, though. He's made content with YouTuber tommyinnit, who tried to pull his mask down while on camera.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In one video</a>, tommyinnit and another YouTuber, Tubbo, can be seen trying to take down Ranboo's mask, while in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another video</a> tommyinnit pulls down Ranboo's mask but blurs the face before we can see anything.
