Her husband Adam Levine may be rich thanks to the band's success, but she has done well for herself. Since Prinsloo used to be a Victoria's Secret model, she earned a high salary for many years. Some <a href=#>Victoria's Secret Angels are still wealthy</a> today and that includes Prinsloo. Now, she has a tequila brand called Calirosa. She seems to have put her heart and soul into it. The brand seems to have become popular and the company's Instagram account has almost 43,000 followers.</p><p>Does Behati Prinsloo actually make a lot of money from Calirosa? And how does her current income compare to her past salary as a hugely popular Victoria's Secret model?</p><h2 id=how-much-money-does-adam-levine-39-s-wife-behati-prinsloo-make-from-calirosa>How Much Money Does Adam Levine's Wife Behati Prinsloo Make From Calirosa?</h2><p>One of the things that Adam Levine's wife <a href=#>Behati Prinsloo shares on her Instagram</a> account is Calirosa, the tequila company that they started. But how much money is Prinsloo taking home from this endeavor?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While exact figures aren't available, and she hasn't mentioned the salary that she takes home, it seems that she must be doing well. However, it's important to note that the couple actually put up the cash themselves and covered start-up costs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/th-image-template-5-3.jpg><p>In an interview with Forcebrands.com, David Gimpelson, Calirosa's president, said he is an equity partner and started the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">company with Levine and Prinsloo</a>.</p><p>Gimpelson told Forcebrands.com, "We’ve created a mentality here with Adam. It was his idea with his wife and they were willing to fund the idea — not just say ‘we’re celebrities, we have an idea, let’s go find someone else’s money to do it,’ which is, I think, a very unique situation for us. I think it shows the belief in the product and puts him in a different category than most celebrities that are involved in brands."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gimpelson continued to Forcebrands.com, "What separates us apart from a lot of celebrity brands is that they are actually putting their money where their mouth is. So they’ve funded 50 percent of the capital to fuel the business."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Behati Prinsloo's Thoughts On Her Daughter Gio Grace Levine Pursuing Music At A Young Age Doesn't Sit Well With Her Older Daughter</a></span></p><p>David Gimpelson explained that 18 people work at Calirosa. While Levine and Prinsloo must be earning enough money to keep going with this company, there are several employees who are being paid a salary.</p><p>People can buy many different types of tequila from Calirosa's website. Each type has a specific description on the website. The description of Rosa Blanco says, "Calirosa’s standout hue, finish, and flavor are on full display from first look to final sip. A statement tequila perfect for drinking under neon lights, in the shadows of the disco ball, from dusk till dawn."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/th-image-template-4-4.jpg><p>What sets Calirosa apart is that the tequila looks pink. And it's a brand that means a lot to Adam Levine and his wife Behati Prinsloo. As she explained in an interview with Travel and Leisure in 2021, she and her husband love going to Mexico for vacations. She said that they took a trip to celebrate when she turned 30 and they also had their wedding in Mexico. And when they found pink tequila, they knew that it was a great business idea.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Is Adam Levine Like As A Dad?</a></span>As Behati Prinsloo told Morning Honey, it's fun to focus on a business like Calirosa because it's so different from her work as a model.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She explained, "It was really cool for us to have 100 percent creative control over a brand that we started from the ground up. Coming from a modeling background, I never had full control over anything. And Adam obviously has a bit more control in his career, but he is in a band, so he and his bandmates always have to agree on everything together."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/behati-prinsloo.jpg><p>Prinsloo told Morning Honey that she and her husband have a good professional relationship because they balance each other out. She said, "Adam is more of a homebody and I’m more at the forefront of the party, going out and really selling the tequila."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Several stars have alcohol companies and have earned a fortune. Today.com reported that Diageo bought George Clooney's Casamigos in 2017. The sale went through for $700 million. And he will take home another $300 million as long as the brand keeps doing well until 2027. If Behati Prinsloo and Adam Levine sell Calirosa, they could earn millions.</p><h2 id=what-was-adam-levine-39-s-wife-behati-prinsloo-39-s-victoria-39-s-secret-salary>What Was Adam Levine's Wife Behati Prinsloo's Victoria's Secret Salary?</h2><p>There are many Victoria's Secret models who made an incredible amount of money. And that seems to include Behati Prinsloo.</p><p>She hasn't shared her exact Victoria's Secret income, and it's not available anywhere. However, Adam Levine's wife Behati Prinsloo seems to have earned most of her money from being a Victoria's Secret Angel. Since she was a Victoria's Secret model starting in 2007 and ending in 2015, she earned money for years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/behati-prinsloo-adam-levine.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And since she has only had her tequila brand Calirosa for a few years, it doesn't seem that she has matched that income yet.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened Between Adam Levine And Instagram Model Sumner Stroh?</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Victoria's Secret models can earn millions</a> annually.

And Lily Aldridge made $4 million.</p><p>It's possible that Adam Levine's wife Behati Prinsloo earned millions every year that she was with Victoria's Secret. But if Calirosa keeps making good money, and if she can sell it in the future, she could match her modeling income.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/behati-prinsloo-and-adam-levine.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Besides the fact that she likely made millions as a Victoria's Secret model, Behati Prinsloo seemed to really like the work.</p><p>In 2014, she was interviewed by Nylon Magazine and said that it was a great experience.
