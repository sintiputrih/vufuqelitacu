His first appearance came in The Masters in April.

However, any hopes that he could build on that were dashed when he withdrew from the PGA Championship after three rounds with his injury still clearly bothering him. Woods then opted to miss the US Open before playing in the 150th Open at St Andrews. Once again, though, the 15-time Major winner was far from at his best, and missed the cut following rounds of 78 and 75.</p><h2 id=video-things-you-didn-apos-t-know-about-tiger-woods-3>Video: Things You Didn't Know About Tiger Woods</h2><p>Those performances coupled with Woods‚Äô absence since July have inevitably led to a tumbling down the rankings.
