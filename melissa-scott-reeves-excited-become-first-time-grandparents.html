In May of that same year, Melissa Reeves thanked her soon-to-be-son-in-law for his service… Emily’s husband Nate had been in Iraq serving with the United States Army. Melissa and Scott Reeves have been married since March 23, 1990 and also share a son Lawrence David Reeves. In 2018, they opened their family business Revival Roast Co. on their Nashville farm in their home state of Tennessee. They’ve described themselves as ‘third wave coffee roasters’, which Scott explained in an April 2019 interview on <i>Pickler & Ben</i>, “First wave, which is coffee we grew up on… the second wave was like the Starbucks… and then along came third wave… there’s a way to brew it, a pour over method… the purest way to do it.” Feel free to watch the full interview below and again, all the best goes out to the Reeves and the Smiths during this special time!</p><p></p><p>Take a look at our gallery of other Days of our Lives real-life couples and sign up for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Soaps.com’s newsletter</a> for daily scoops sent to your inbox.</p><p>Video: Pickler and Ben/YouTube</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmnZmpqHqwsoyorKtlnJ7Dpr%2BOp5ywq19qgnh9j29mpp2cnsC0rYysmqispGK%2FprHVnqpmnaiYtrWxw2aZnpuforJussirqq1lpJ66pnnGq5innKCWv6a606xm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ipeleng-bbtitans-elaine-selepe-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-561874-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ipeleng BBTitans, Elaine Selepe Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram,</span></a>
