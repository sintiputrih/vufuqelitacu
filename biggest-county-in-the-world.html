When we talk about counties, we usually mean the administrative divisions of a country or a state that have some local government functions.
However, not all countries use the term county for their subdivisions, and some use it for different types of entities.
For example, in the United Kingdom, a county can be a historic county, a ceremonial county, a metropolitan county, or a non-metropolitan county."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
