But that’s because I’d seen his penis long before the movie came out, when I actually had a hangover. But that’s a whole other story I’d rather not get into. On our first day of production, there was that moment when I looked at him and paused for a second and thought, Hmm. I know exactly what that man’s penis looks like. And then you kind of move on with your day. You just have to put it out of your head. —<strong>Joel McHale</strong> on seeing his Community co-star Ken Jeong [<a href=#>VF</a>]</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-94d46ecec5602e5dec03549d6d6c3cbf-3-0-0@published data-word-count=61>“I like the rumpus.

It became like being in a play. It was like, ‘Okay, an hour and 52 minutes from now, I’m going to be …,’ and I found after doing that for months and months, it was pretty hard to stay in the present. I’d be up onstage thinking, I should’ve ordered the chicken sandwich. And I hate that feeling. I couldn’t concentrate enough to get myself back — I was a robot that goes through the show. —<strong>Trent Reznor</strong> hates thinking about sandwiches onstage [<a href=#>AV Club</a>]</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Keanu Reeves Remembers Patrick Swayze, Defiant Skydiver</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlncmdgbnysscCnrJiqlZrDpr%2B%2Bq5ymnZ2XsrO%2FvqmYraqZmLhvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./does-nico-mirallegro-on-ridley-have-a-wife-meet-the-actor-playing-cal-flannery-on-ridley-425876-html.html><span>←</span><span>Does Nico Mirallegro On Ridley Have A Wife?
