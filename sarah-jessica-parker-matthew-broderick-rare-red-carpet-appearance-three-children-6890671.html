James, who is a student at Brown University, wore a black suit with a festive red and green plaid tie that coordinated with his dad's jacket, while his younger sisters dressed similarly in long dresses, floral overcoats, and heels.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">SJP, for her part, wore a blue sequined dress underneath a white coat, and accessorized with mismatched polka-dot heeled sandals and strands of pearls.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Marion and Tabitha previously joined their mom at the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hocus Pocus 2 premiere</a> back in September, and James has also hit the red carpet from time to time with his famous parents over the years, but for the most part, Parker and Broderick attempt to keep their children out of the spotlight. However, they do occasionally make an appearance on SJP's Instagram grid.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Last year, the mom of three got emotional after sending her son off to college and her daughters to middle school. "In the span of 7 days. One crosses the threshold into his freshman year of college. The other 2 into 7th grade," she wrote alongside a photo of each child, obscuring their faces for privacy. She added, "The house is different. We are different. They need us more. And far less. So many know. Gutted at the time passed. Passing. Exhilarated by the possibilities that await them. The love. The love. The love."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570pqpmqBdn7K0v8icmGaokae4pr6MppitrJiaxG6u0aibnqqZmLhuvsCrnGaqlZl6pK3RqZytZZGlvaat0ZqlnJ1dqbWzscRmmqGhnJm%2FprqMb29yaGZsfg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lily-tomlin.html><span>←</span><span>Lily Tomlin Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Wife, Big Chair, Jane Fonda, Movies, TV Shows, and Net Worth.</span></a>
