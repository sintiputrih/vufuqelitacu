Although, on that note,<a href=#> rumor has it that she might leave MCU...</a>&nbsp;She has fame, beauty, wealth, a <a href=#>handsome husband and amazing kids </a>whom she loves dearly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After such a long and successful career, one would undoubtedly wonder how much the 47-year-old celebrity's net worth actually is.</p><p>Paltrow is not only an actress but a singer, author, and businesswoman. She was cast in Hook (1991) which was directed by her godfather, Steven Spielberg. She received many positive reviews and several awards for her acting. Later in 1995, she stunned the audience with her performance in Se7en as a young's wife detective and received another movie in 1996, which was Emma.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwyneth Paltrow And 14 Other Celebs Who Came Clean About The Roles They Regret</a></span></p><p>According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, the Iron Man actress first starred in Shakespeare in Love for her stunning performance which earned her an Oscar and a paycheck that could have been any celebrity's dream at the time; a whopping $750,000 US Dollars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After that, things just began to skyrocket for her when she was cast for many super-hit films such as The Talented Mr. Ripley, Contagion and of course, our very favorite the Avengers Franchise.</p><p>In 2000, Paltrow took to stage to show display her singing skills in the movie Duets which was directed by her father. In 2010, she was cast in Country Song where she played a role as a country singer and also several other movies where she could continue to show off her talent.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything We Know About Brad Pitt And Gwyneth Paltrow's Relationship In The 90s</a></span></p><p>In 2003, Paltrow was cast in View From The Top which Gwyneth went on to call 'the worst movie ever!' since it's gross was only $19.5 million US Dollars globally but the actress did receive her $10 million US Dollars so maybe the experience wasn't all that bad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paltrow's role in the Iron Man Franchise was very profitable as well. In 2008, as we all know, the first movie was a box-office hit and it earned over $585 million US Dollars worldwide; not to mention, worthwhile reviews and applauds from fans and celebrities alike.</p><p>One would think that she was satisfied with just being an actress at the time. But&nbsp;people were really surprised to find out&nbsp;that she had opened up her own lifestyle brand called <a href=#>Goop</a>. Paltrow began her journey by sending delicious recipes and wellness tips to her fans through newsletters to her email subscribers. Eventually though, Goop turned into an e-Commerce business and&nbsp;started to become a hit. Paltrow only earned $1.5 million in sales in 2012 but as of last year, Goop is estimated to be valued at over $250 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwyneth Paltrow's Selling A Candle That Smells Like Her...</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And just when we thought that that was it, there comes more. Apart from Goop, Paltrow turned her passion into profit as well. Gwyneth Paltrow wrote several cookbooks and also appeared in Spain... On The Road Again, a 2008 PBS documentary. She is a spokesperson for Estee Lauder fragrances and Bean Pole International.&nbsp; In addition,&nbsp;she narrated audiobooks in Bill Martin's Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?&nbsp;This earned her a Grammy nomination for Best Spoke-Word Album for Children in 2009.</p><p>The Shallow Hal actress might be loved by some and hated by some but It's only right to say that Paltrow is her own woman who struggled and came to the top&nbsp;through her own hard-work. She is beautiful, amazing, talented and all her movies combined gross over $8.8 billion worldwide!</p><p>As of April 2020, Paltrow's net worth is $160 million US Dollars.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Natural Face, Nice Gesture.
