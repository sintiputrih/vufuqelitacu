He wrote,&nbsp;“Covid really sucks. last night i was tryna watch porn then i sneezed snot all over penis lmao.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Since those tweets, Lil Nas has been silent on his social media accounts. He’s among many people in the U.S. who recently tested positive for COVID, as the Omicron variant spreads at an alarmingly rapid rate. Other stars to recently contract the virus include <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Charlie Puth</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lisa Rinna</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Erika Girardi</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Garcelle Beauvais</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Keira Knightley</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Aside from this COVID diagnosis, Lil Nas had a pretty great 2021. His <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first full-length album</a> came out in September and was a huge hit with music critics and fans. Lil Nas earned five nominations for the upcoming <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2022 Grammy Awards</a>, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year for “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)”, and Album of the Year for&nbsp;Montero.
