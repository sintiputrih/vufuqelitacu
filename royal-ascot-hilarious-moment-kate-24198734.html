<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Royal Ascot: The hilarious moment Kate Middleton caught Sophie Wessex as she tripped in her carriage</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Royal Ascot is one of the most highly anticipated events of The Royal Family's diary every year and it always prompts some of the most wonderful family moments as they come together to cheer on the horses and enjoy the day. Royal Ascot runs from June 14 until June 18 this year and will no doubt see many members of The Royal Family join in with the events.</p><p>The official website explains that "at 2pm sharp of each day The Royal Landaus, led by four Windsor Greys, approach along the famous Straight Mile. It’s a short but spectacular journey that since 1825 has signalled the start of the Royal Meeting. After the Royal Procession passes through the Parade Ring, it's time for the horses and jockeys to take centre stage, with the first of seven races taking place at 2.30pm."</p><p>There have been countless memorable moments from Royal Ascot over the years but one stands out in particular. On the first day of the events in 2017, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and The Earl and Countess of Wessex were readying themselves to get into their carriage for the Royal Procession when something hilarious happened.</p><p><b>READ MORE: <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>The adorable moment Princess Charlotte corrected Prince George's posture just like the Queen on Buckingham Palace balcony</a></b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article24198810.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_2.jpg><p>Sophie followed Catherine into the carriage and took a tumble forwards but was luckily caught before disaster struck in front of the cameras. The pair clearly found the moment funny as they both erupted into a fit of giggles before their carriage pulled off for the Royal Procession.</p><p>The Countess of Wessex is a regular visitor to Royal Ascot and will no doubt be in attendance during this year's festivities. In previous years, Sophie has been pictured cheering for the horses she has backed from the royal enclosure and celebrating her victory with other members of the family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article24198834.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-698461162.jpg><p>The Royal Enclosure has a long and important history at Ascot. The official website explains: "The origins of the Royal Enclosure can be traced back to 1807 when an area was reserved exclusively for family, guests and the Household of King George III to view the first running of the Gold Cup."</p><p>It continues: "The Royal Enclosure as we know it today was established in the mid-nineteenth century when the Emperor of Russia, Nicholas I, visited Ascot for the first time as a guest of Queen Victoria and her husband Prince Albert.</p><p>"The concern raised from an impromptu descent into the Winners’ Enclosure by the Emperor, the King of Saxony and Prince Albert to examine the winner of the Queen’s Vase, prompted authorities to enclose the area in front of the Royal Stand in 1845. Excluding the Royal Stand, this area immediately became the most exclusive part of the racecourse."</p><p><b>Have a story you think we should be covering?
