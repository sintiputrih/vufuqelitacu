Instead, he claimed to have captured footage of the young boy attempting to escape the painting. The sellers added that anyone seeking to purchase the painting would have to sign a disclaimer releasing them from all liability.</p><p>The whole thing went viral. The eBay listing was visited 30,000 times, and many people claimed that simply viewing the painting on their computer screens made them physically ill, caused them to blackout and lose time, or hear creepy voices. The price ballooned from $199 to $1,025. The winning bid was a gallery owner, and the painting remains in storage in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAlXFrcWlfqbWmedKcmKuxXajBsL7YZpmeoJmjsW7Ax55kpqejqXqprdSnq56cXaWuqrrToqWgZZmjeqm10q2mq7Ff</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shaun-alexander.html><span>←</span><span>Shaun Alexander</span></a>
