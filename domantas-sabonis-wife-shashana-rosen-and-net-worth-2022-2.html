After popping the question to his girlfriend Shashana Rosen, Sabonis wrote on Instagram, “He’s the luckiest man in the world.”</p><p>In an article published on Pacers.com in April, Sabonis claimed that he left for his winter residence in Los Angeles soon after the NBA season was postponed.</p><p>He shared a home with Shashana, who was close to her family. Rosen was a dancer for the Los Angeles Lakers’ Laker Girls, according to her Instagram. She co-founded The Company, Superstars Dance Studio, and The Movement – LA.</p><p>Victor Oladipo, Sabonis’ teammate for the Pacers, was the first to congratulate him. T.J. Warren, Malcolm Brogdon, T.J. McConnell, and Alize Johnson joined him. Tyreke Evans and Darren Collison, two former Pacers teammates, also sent their best wishes.</p><p>Shashana Rosen is three years younger than Domantas Sabonis. On the other hand, their bond was unaffected by age. She became his legal wife after the adorable couple was married. Age of Shashana is 28, and she was born on &nbsp;October 15, 1992</p><p>Shoshana has a 10k follower Instagram account with only 285 posts. Unfortunately, her account has been made private. Shoshana’s parents had previously given their marriage their blessing. Twice, Sabonis was named an All-NBA Star. Rosen is merely a celebrity partner on Wikipedia. Hence she lacks a title or a biography.</p><p>On the other hand, Sabonis has a wiki page. Sage is the name of Shashana’s younger brother. He has more than 1.1 million followers on TikTok.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=domantas-sabonis-net-worth-in-2022></span>Domantas Sabonis Net Worth In 2022<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>His estimated net worth is between $1 million and $6 million, according to sources.</p><p>The league games are his primary source of income, and he brings in a respectable sum each year. He received about $2.44 million from the Oklahoma City Thunders for just his debut campaign. He made close to $28 million over nearly five years after agreeing to a new contract with the Pacers.</p><p>At the moment, the power forward for the Sacramento Kings is paid $18.5 million annually. Domantas’ NBA career has already brought in roughly $31 million. In addition, the footballer has made some money from selling merchandise and endorsing brands like Citadele Bank and ANC earphones.</p><p>His accolades and accomplishments include:</p><p>All-Star NBA (2020, 2021)<br>All-WCC first team (2016)<br>AP Exceptional Mention All-American (2016)<br>WCC Freshman All-Star Team (2015)<br>all-second-team WCC (2015)</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=son-of-hall-of-famer-arvydas-sabonis-meet-domantas-parents></span>Son Of Hall Of Famer Arvydas Sabonis: Meet Domantas Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Arvydas Sabonis, an NBA Hall of Famer, is the father of Domantas. In addition to being a previous EuroBasket MVP, the illustrious Portland Trail Blazers star was named to the FIBA’s Greatest Players list in 1991.</p><p>He has his father’s blood, and like his father, he has emerged in gaming and established his reputation and popularity. His father’s current phase serves as an inspiration to him.</p><p>When the Indiana Pacers and Sacramento Kings square off in a pair of preseason games at the NCSI Dome in Mumbai in October, Sabonis will be the only second-generation superstar to walk the court.</p><p>In 2018, the Lithuanian Basketball Federation awarded Sabonis the prestigious Lithuanian Player of the Year in his second season with the Pacers. Sabonis, therefore, managed to make it from his upbringing here to his club basketball youth in Malaga, Spain, and finally to the NBA without ever posting up his well-known father.</p><p>Sabonis, a rookie for the Thunder and the son of basketball legend Arvydas Sabonis, responded, “Never. Never had that opportunity. Dad wasn’t avoiding, according to Sabonis.</p><p>The family lived in an apartment in Malaga, although it was a comfortable one. There was no basketball court close by. And once his son’s club career began, and Arvydas Sabonis’ basketball career ended, the one-on-one opportunity never materialized.</p><p>Arvydas Sabonis told The Oklahoman, “You don’t have time. He added that Arvydas “never sought to push.” He wasn’t involved since he wanted his kids to come to basketball on their own. However, Arvydas’ traces may be seen throughout the son’s game.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-sabonis-came-in-highlight-all-about-his-career></span>How Sabonis Came in Highlight, All About His Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2003–04, Arvydas ended his basketball career, and Domantas and his family moved to Malaga, Spain. Nevertheless, he was just sixteen years old, he didn’t enter into a professional deal with Unicaja that included a payment to maintain his NCAA eligibility.</p><p>To play in the NCAA, Sabonis declined a three-year, $630,000 contract from Unicaja.&nbsp; He committed to Gonzaga University’s NCAA Division I team before the 2014–15 season.</p><p>He assisted the Gonzaga Bulldogs in their 91-75 victory over the BYU Cougars on March 10 to help them win the WCC Tournament Title for the third time in a row. The Orlando Magic picked Sabonis with the 11th overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft.</p><p>On draft night, he was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Serge Ibaka along with Ersan Lyasova and Victor Oladipo.</p><p>In a 103-97 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on October 26 as the team’s starting power forward, he made his Thunder debut. In 16 minutes, he scored five points and pulled down four rebounds.</p><p>While the Thunder were the sixth seed in the 2016–17 NBA Playoffs, they were defeated 4–1 by the Houston Rockets in the opening round, and Sabonis saw just six minutes of action. On July 6, 2017, Sabonis and Victor Oladipo were exchanged for Paul George by the Indiana Pacers.</p><p>Due to the unexpected trade, he was not only unable to take part in the 2017 NBA Summer League, but he was also unable to play for the Lithuanian national team during the 2017 EuroBasket. The Pacers and Sabonis agreed to a four-year, $77 million contract the day before the 2019–20 season began.</p><p>Sabonis became only the second Lithuanian to be selected as an NBA All-Star for his outstanding accomplishments, earning him a spot in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game with an average of 18 points, 12.8 rebounds, and 4.6 assists.</p><p>Sabonis also participated in the 2020 NBA All-Star Weekend Skills Challenge, where he lost against Bam Adebayo in the championship round but came close to taking home the trophy.</p><p>He contributed to Team LeBron’s 157-155 triumph in his first All-Star appearance, putting him on the winning side. In 2015, Sabonis made his EuroBasket debut for Lithuania, taking home a silver medal. He competed for Lithuania’s Olympic national team at the 2016 Summer Olympics.</p><p>The Pacers dealt Sabonis, Justin Holiday, Jeremy Lamb, and a 2023 second-round pick to the Sacramento Kings on February 8, 2022 in exchange for Tristan Thompson, Buddy Hield, and Tyrese Haliburton.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shashana-rosen-and-nba-player-domantas-sabonis-have-a-first-born-child></span>Shashana Rosen and NBA player Domantas Sabonis have a first-born child<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>With a smile on his face, Sabonis opened the news conference by stating, “He didn’t play because they had a kid. “It’s great and He’s quite excited.”</p><p>Domantas and Shashana wed in a secret ceremony at a French chateau while keeping their private lives a secret. Late in the summer of 2020, the two turned into husbands and wives.</p><p>Tautvydas, Domant’s brother, similarly has a waiting attitude so he waited to share the news. Basketball player’s father Arvydas Sabonis revealed in November that he and his wife Paulina were expanding their family.</p><p>“The first son should get married in the upcoming years, while the second and third boys are already married. Tautvydas ought to give us grandchildren soon, thought Arvydas. Arvydas acknowledged the pleasantries and then spoke of the other kids as well.</p><p>The newborn has been a source of great delight for Sabonis and his wife. Through social media, the pair are increasingly sharing their daily joy with their thousands of followers. The mother of the son revealed the child’s name and its origins of it in one of the most recent blogs.</p><p>Up until recently, “For Atlantic Life” creator and basketball player D. Sabonis wished his beloved Shashana a happy first Mother’s Day. The well-known athlete even revealed some intimate photos from this event, which also show their newborn child and tender moments.</p><p>The family, who just welcomed their first child, appear to be embracing motherhood and spreading their delight to their close friends and fans. Rosen recently shared images on Instagram that appear to document every month of her pregnancy.</p><p>The day after the baby was born, Delphi learned that D. Sabonis and his wife had become parents, but neither the basketball player nor his wife had made an announcement. ESPN swiftly announced the wonderful news, and afterward, D. Sabonis’ response was published.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=domantas-sabonis-of-the-kings-was-given-a-one-game-suspension></span>Domantas Sabonis of the Kings was given a one-game suspension<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Domantas Sabonis, a center for the Sacramento Kings, was given a one-game suspension by the NBA on Wednesday, March 2022 for aggressively approaching and making physical contact with a referee who had given him a technical foul.</p><p>In the fourth quarter of Monday night’s game against the New York Knicks, Sabonis was dismissed for getting two technical fouls.</p><p>The first was for an improper response to a foul call. The league claimed that he then “approached and bumped the official aggressively,” which resulted in the second technical and his dismissal.</p><p>The Kings expressed their disagreement with the suspension in a statement. He is the ultimate competitor and a consummate professional, the group claimed. “They support Domas wholeheartedly, and they stand behind him.”</p><p>In the Kings’ 131-115 defeat, Sabonis led the team with 19 points and 13 rebounds. After falling behind 20 points, the Knicks came back. Sabonis commented after the game, “It was just a frustrating game.” We consistently play well and take large leads, but we are never able to maintain them in the second half.</p><p>When the Kings meet the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday night, Sabonis will serve his suspension. He has played in 11 games for Sacramento since being acquired from the Indiana Pacers before the trade deadline, averaging 17.4 points, 12.8 rebounds, and 5.9 assists.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyfoq6vwMCsZKyZkqS7qr%2BMsKCfnV2otaK%2Fx5qlmmWipMCmuoyapZ1lnprBbsPOq6uhZWJlf3N5kWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./apple-announces-watchos-3.html><span>←</span><span>Apple Announces WatchOS 3</span></a>
