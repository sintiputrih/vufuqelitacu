The incident occurred while Lior was celebrating his birthday at a peaceful gathering, where Hamas fighters opened fire, resulting in multiple casualties, including Lior.</p><p>The loss of lives has continued to mount since Hamas breached the border, causing widespread devastation in Israel. In response to this surprise attack, the Israeli government officially declared war and authorized significant military actions to retaliate against Hamas.</p><p>In the days that followed, Israel’s military worked tirelessly to confront Hamas fighters in various towns and increased airstrikes on the Gaza Strip. The toll has been heart-wrenching, with over 1,100 people losing their lives and thousands more sustaining injuries on both sides.</p><p>Despite over 40 hours of intense battles, Israeli forces are still engaged in combat with militants who are holed up in different areas.</p><p>The loss of life in Israel is unlike anything the country has seen in decades, with at least 700 individuals tragically reported dead. At the same time, over 400 lives have been lost in Gaza.</p><p>Read Also: <a href=# rel=noopener>Where Is Jake Marlowe?

Little did anyone know that this child would grow up to be a football sensation.</p><p>Lior’s football journey began in the youth system of Maccabi Herzliya. He was passionate about the game and dedicated himself to honing his skills. Eventually, he earned a spot on the club’s senior team during the 1997/1998 season. For five years, he wore the jersey of Maccabi Herzliya with pride.</p><p>However, his path wasn’t without its challenges. The team faced relegation just two seasons after he joined, but Lior’s determination remained unshaken.</p><p>In the 2002/2003 season, Lior made a move to Maccabi Petah Tikva, seeking new opportunities and challenges. His courage to step out of his comfort zone paid off.</p><p>After a single season with Maccabi Petah Tikva, he embarked on another adventure, this time with Bnei Sakhnin. It was here that he achieved a remarkable feat by won the State Cup.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Former Israeli Soccer Player Lior Asulin" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Former-Israeli-Soccer-Player-Lior-Asulin.webp alt="Former Israeli Soccer Player Lior Asulin" width=400 height=473 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Asulin’s Football Career&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Back in the 2001-02 season, Lior Asulin set the Liga Leumit on fire with an incredible 28 goals. It was a breathtaking performance that left everyone in awe.</p><p>Club chairman Ariel Shaiman saw the potential and decided to loan Lior to top-tier clubs while securing him with a long-term contract at Herzliya. The goal? To eventually cash in on a big transfer fee. And boy, did Lior deliver!</p><p>During his loan spells, he not only helped his teams win the State Cup but also established himself as one of Israel’s top strikers in the domestic league. That was quite a rise to stardom!</p><p><img decoding=async title="Lior Asulin killed by Hamas terrorists" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lior-Asulin-killed-by-Hamas-terrorists.webp alt="Lior Asulin killed by Hamas terrorists" width=400 height=496 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Then, in the 2005-06 season, Ariel Shaiman spilled the beans to the media. He revealed that there were lucrative offers pouring in from clubs all over the world.</p><p>Olympique de Marseille and OGC Nice in France, teams from Russia, Turkey, three from Cyprus, and even a Greek club were all keen on signing Lior.</p><p>After winning the State Cup with Bnei Sakhnin, Lior made another surprising move by joining Beitar Jerusalem on a loan</p><p><img decoding=async title="Lior Asulin wife Moran Asulin" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lior-Asulin-wife-Moran-Asulin.webp alt="Lior Asulin wife Moran Asulin" width=400 height=424 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Asulin’s Disturbing Married Life</strong></h2><p>Lior Asulin’s marriage to Moran Asulin was filled with ups and downs that kept everyone on their toes. It all began in 2008 when Moran accused him of physical aggression and making threats.</p><p>The police got involved, and Lior ended up with a three-day house arrest at his parents’ place. Strangely, he was allowed to attend Maccabi PAT training during that time.</p><p>Lior’s mom didn’t hold back either. She openly talked about how difficult their marriage had been right from the start. Then, in April 2018, Lior’s name hit the news again, this time for his involvement in selling cannabis through a network called Telegrass.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Lior Asulin kids" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lior-Asulin-kids.webp alt="Lior Asulin kids" width=400 height=453 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>But three years later, he was convicted of being involved in 30 drug trafficking cases. That landed him a hefty 19-month prison sentence. On November 2, 2021, his appeal against the sentence was denied, and he started serving his term on December 8.</p><p>But In August 2022, after spending eight months behind bars, Lior was released because he had behaved well in prison. It seemed like he was turning his life around and finding happiness with his children.</p><p>Unfortunately, tragedy struck when an extremist group took his life, ending his journey of ups and downs.</p><p>Read Also: <a href=# rel=noopener>Where is Noa Argamani?
