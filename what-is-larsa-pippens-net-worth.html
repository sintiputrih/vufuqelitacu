<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>What Is Larsa Pippen's Net Worth?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Larsa Pippen was born Larsa Younan in Chicago, Illinois, on July 6, 1974. She secured fame after she married NBA star Scottie Pippen.&nbsp;The pair got married in 1997 and went on to welcome four kids, including Scotty Jr. (2000), Preston (2002), Justin (2005), and Sophia (2008).&nbsp;</p><p>They remained married for almost two decades before announcing their split in 2016. They later reconciled but could not fix what was broken in their relationship. Larsa and Scottie filed for divorce in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>The second divorce filing came amid rumors that she had stepped out on Scottie with rapper Future. However, Larsa denied those rumors as the reason for their split.</p><p>Larsa Pippen’s estimated<a href=#> net worth</a> is slated north of $10 million. She earned most of that thanks to her modeling career and appearance as a cast member in “The Real Housewives of Miami.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lar-1.jpg><p>The reality TV show was Larsa’s entry into reality TV as a full-time cast member. However, she only appeared in the show’s first season and not in season 2.&nbsp;</p><p>Larsa also appeared on “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” because she had a great relationship with Kim Kardashian. At least until Kanye West reportedly ruined it.&nbsp;</p><p>She reportedly had an affair with<a href=#> Tristan Thompson</a>, Khloe Kardashian’s on-again-off-again boyfriend. Larsa has denied this, but she and Kim no longer follow each other on social media.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Larsa_Pippen_Has_Been_Up_To></span>What Larsa Pippen Has Been Up To<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Larsa has been in the news lately because she has a new beau fans are curious about. His name is Marcus Jordan, and they have both been keeping things hush-hush.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/marc.jpg><p>Of course, this has only made people more curious about what is happening. The TV star and the entrepreneur initially sparked dating rumors after they were pictured grabbing lunch in September 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>An informant would later reveal that month that Larsa and Jordan are “dating and have been spending more time together in recent weeks.”&nbsp;The source also <a href=#>claimed</a> that the pair wanted to keep their relationship discreet due to the feud between Scottie Pippen and Marcus Jordan.</p><p>As mentioned, Larsa was formerly married to Scottie, who played for the Chicago Bulls alongside Michael, Marcus’s dad.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/haute-living-ny-and-louis-xiii-cognac-collectors-dinner-in-honor-of-nba-all-star-weekend-2015-1024x768.jpg><p>The two retired NBA stars shared a tight bond during their careers in the 1980s and 1990s. However, a rivalry brewed between them.&nbsp;In November 2021, Scottie revealed in his Unguarded memoir that he was “upset” that Michael glossed over their NBA history in his documentary, “The Last Dance.”&nbsp;</p><p>He thought the documentary “glorified” Michael without giving enough respect to him and their teammates.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Larsas_Latest_Feud></span>Larsa’s Latest Feud&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Larsa has a relatively quiet feud history compared to many other reality TV stars. However, she has been in several feuds too. Her latest would be her recent fallout with host Tamron Hall. In February 2023, Larsa sat down with Hall and discussed her budding relationship with Marcus. However, it did not end well.</p><p>According to Larsa, Hall was very “negative and judgemental” about everything, and the TV star picked up on it immediately.&nbsp;Larsa later <a href=#>said</a> about the interview:</p><p>“She was very negative and judgmental. Her tone and social expressions indicated she never wanted an honest conversation. If she wants to audition for housewives, I know somebody.”</p><p>Larsa’s comment came after Hall defended herself for asking the reality TV star pointed questions about what she shared with Marcus Jordan during the interview. Hall said after hearing Larsa felt she had been “too hard” on her: “I want [people] to know that this is an authentic conversation. My job is not to waste the time of the people watching at home.”</p><p>Hall also mentioned that she tries to create a “respectful environment” for guests on her talk show, but Larsa didn’t feel that way.&nbsp;Nobody can tell how long the <a href=#>feud</a> between the two women will last, but fans hope one takes the high road and let things fizzle out.</p><p>In the meantime, Larsa is happy with Marcus and ready for whatever the future holds for them. This could be whether they go their separate ways or end up at the altar to say, ‘I do.’</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKmt02agrGWclr%2B0rYypoKmolaPAbrrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./staci-keanan-bio-now-age-height-movies-net-worth-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Staci Keanan Bio, Career, Early Life, Movies &amp;amp; Net Worth</span></a>
