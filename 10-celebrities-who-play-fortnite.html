The man has more number ones than a desk calendar, so it makes sense that when he played Fortnite with Ninja, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">set a new</a> Twitch record in the process.</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=467 data-injectable=true>Over 600,000 people logged in to see him play, easily beating the previous record of 388,000 set by Dr DisRespect. At that time, Drake said he had only been playing the game about a month or so, and used it to blow off some steam after arduous studio sessions.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Roseanne</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>Roseanne, yes the one from the crazy popular ’90s sitcom who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">got cancelled</a> a few years back for some incendiary remarks, also loves the game.</p><p data-characters=102 data-current-count=102 data-injectable=false>She took to Twitter (Now X) to reveal that not only does she love to play the game, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she dominates it</a>.</p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>“I have 20 fortnite victory royale wins,” she said in 2018. Of course, we don’t have any concrete proof of this, and sure it sounds like hyperbole, but just picturing Roseanne owning n00bs is enough to garner at least a chuckle.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Finn Wolfhard</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=152 data-injectable=false>Perhaps best known as the lanky Mike Wheeler in the hit show Stranger Things, Finn Wolfhard is well-known in the gaming community as a Fortnite player.</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>He’s streamed a lot on his now rarely used Twitch channel, and he’s been vocal about the game on X as well. On TikTok, there are also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">various videos</a> of the celebrity playing the game.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Norm Macdonald</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=647 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>Norm Macdonald, RIP, was one of the most beloved, well-known and hilarious people to ever perform standup comedy. While he passed away tragically a few years back, we’re still learning things about him all these years later.</p><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>One of the more esoteric facts about the star is that he was a Fortnite player. He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">took to X</a> to taunt the world about it in a way only he could.</p><p data-characters=108 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true>“There is no one who can beat me at Fortnite,” he said. “And I mean NO ONE!!!!!!!!”</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, we’ll never be able to test those fighting words to find out if it was true, or he was just riling people up in true Macdonald fashion. It’s probably the latter, but how great would it be if it wasn’t.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Joe Jonas</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>Joe Jonas, of Jonas Brothers, DNCE and marrying Sophie Turner fame, is a regular Fortnite player. He is so dedicated to the craft that he invited players from all over the world to play with him by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sharing his Fortnite user name</a>.</p><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>“Playing Fortnite username: CrackedPig8153 come join my team.” I’m sure he made a lot of teenagers and 20 somethings very happy with that tweet.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Lil Yachty</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>Popular rapper Lil Yachty is a big-time Fortnite proponent. He participated in the Fortnite Celebrity Pro-Am, which gave $3 million to charity. He teamed up with TBNRFrags, a gaming streamer with almost 8 million subscribers on YouTube.</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=493 data-injectable=true>He also started a Twitch channel, but quickly bailed on it after streaming and the chat turned against him. The chat started telling him how much he sucked, and he didn’t like that so he said “I don’t care, I’m a millionaire.”</p><p data-characters=45 data-current-count=45 data-injectable=false>Can’t really argue with that, we guess.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Ariana Grande</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=589 data-injectable=true>Pop singer Ariana Grande’s participation in Fortnite goes well beyond simply playing the game, she’s in the game! Grande performed a virtual concert in the game, and it was just another way that Fortnite proved to be groundbreaking.</p><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=201 data-injectable=false>The concert wasn’t just a one-off, either. It was tied into the game in exciting ways. Players were taken through portals before she even appeared, and they got to play a bunch of fun mini games.</p><p data-characters=106 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>This means that Grande is now a part of the games extensive lore, and that’s not a bad thing at all.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Tristan Thompson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-8.png><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>To a certain segment of the population, Thompson is one of the most famous people around. Sure, some of this fame comes from being a professional basketball player, but mostly it’s from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly cheating</a> on Khloe Kardashian.</p><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=true>Regardless, Thomson showed off his affinity for the game during a birthday party for his daughter last year. In an Instagram story, he shares a picture of himself and his daughter with the caption “You will always be my number 1 pick in Fortnite duos momma.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Patrick Mahomes</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=504 data-injectable=true>NFL Quarterback Patrick Mahomes not only plays the game, he’s in the game! Mahomes outfits and accessories were added to the Fortnite item shop last year, and they proved to be exceedingly popular.</p><p data-characters=31 data-current-count=31 data-injectable=false>Here’s what he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said on X</a>:</p><p data-characters=153 data-current-count=184 data-injectable=false>“Yesterday i played fortnite for the first time in a while and someone killed me with my jersey on.. don’t know how i feel about it…”</p><p data-characters=116 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>Mahomes is one of quite a few sports legends to join the game, including LeBron James and tennis player Naomi Osaka.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Chance the Rapper</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=234 data-injectable=false>Like we’ve discussed before, Fortnite isn’t just a video game, it’s a cultural force that features movies, concerts and TV shows. Chance the Rapper actually released his prank show reboot of Punk’d in the game.</p><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=377 data-injectable=false>He’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted a few times</a> about the game, including back in 2020 when he announced he would be playing live on Twitch for everyone to see.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=377 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2R%2BcXnCnqOemqKewaqx0mauoaddpbmixYyfpqusnp7Bpns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./warren-beatty-2.html><span>←</span><span>Warren Beatty Age, Net Worth, Wife, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</span></a>
