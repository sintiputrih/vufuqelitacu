His fame comes from the fact that Randy is the executive producer if the popular television show, “America’s Best Dance Crew” on MTV. He has also been a judge on “American Idol”, another popular show on TV. As a producer, he has already won a Grammy Award.</p><p>Born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 1956, Randy was a bass guitar player when he was young. He was good at it too. In fact, he used to play with some of the big names such as Carlos Santana&nbsp;and Jerry Garcia. He used to be a member of the “Taxxi” band as well, though for just a short while. Jackson used to be a bass guitarist for many musicians like Tracy Chapman, Bruce Springsteen, and The Divinyls. Jackson went on a tour with Mariah Carey&nbsp;as well. So he was good at what he did back then. The relation with Carey has struck, as Randy has worked with her throughout.</p><p>But eventually, Randy began to get into songwriting and production. He started working for San Francisco Bay Productions with Walter Afanasieuff and Narad Michael Walden. His work became popular too. He was making a name for himself in the new role.</p><p>Apart from his association with American Idol and America’s Best Dance Crew, Randy has also been doing radio programs. He hosts the “Randy Jackson’s Hit List” show, which is a top 40 countdown for the week.</p><p>He has been married twice and has three children – two daughters (Taylor and Zoe) and a son (Jordan).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fp66vsNhmoZqbm6i8r7%2BMm6Con6KWvanFjJ%2BYnKxdmK6zscSrZJqvkaextHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5y6KdnmWjqbyzxY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./move-over-funimation-and-crunchyroll-these-are-the-best-anime-on-hidive.html><span>←</span><span>Move over Funimation and Crunchyroll these are the best anime on HIDIVE</span></a>
