These are efficiency, efficacy, and effectiveness. Efficacy is the potential which a procedure solves a certain problem and is determined during developmental research and also in trials. The efficiency of a process can be measured by comparing with other processes and also by way of cost and benefit analysis. Effectiveness may, however, vary due to the impact of other intervening factors present in the procedure implementation.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>For example, in a water project, the outcome will be the percentage of households that have access to the eater. Another example would a scenario whereby an organization organizes a human rights workshop. In this case, the outcome of the project would be the number of community members who have successfully been able to seek their human rights. <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=similarities-between-output-and-outcome></span>Similarities between output and outcome<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Both describe changes at different levels in the provision of service provision<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=differences-between-output-and-outcome></span>Differences between<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>Output and Outcome<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><li><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=level-of-results></span>Level of results<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3></li><p>While output is the first level of results associated with a project, the outcome is the second level of results associated with a project.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><li><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=measure-of-value></span>Measure of value<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3></li><p>While outputs do not address the impact or value of the services, the outcome is reflected by the level of achievement or performance that occurred due to the activities or services provided.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><li><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=mode-of-assessment-in-output-and-outcome></span>Mode of assessment in Output and Outcome<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3></li><p>Outputs are not an appropriate indicator of effectiveness.
