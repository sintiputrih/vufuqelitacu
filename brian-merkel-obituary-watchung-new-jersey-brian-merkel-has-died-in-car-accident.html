On August 27th, 2023, we lost a beloved husband, father, grandfather, brother, and friend. Kenneth, affectionately known as ‘Kenny’ or ‘Merk’, entered this world on September 15th, 1953, in Baltimore, Maryland, to the late Stephen J. Merkel and Virginia M. Merkel.</p><p>Ken shared an enduring love story with his wife, Virginia ‘Ginna’ Merkel, celebrating 34 years of unwavering commitment and love. His pride shone brightest in the presence of his two children, Scott Brian Merkel and Lindsey Rae Merkel, and he cherished his role as ‘pop’ to his grandson, Maverick Brian Merkel.</p><p>Renowned for his ability to leave a lasting impression, Ken touched the lives of all who crossed his path. His life’s purpose revolved around spreading joy, offering laughter, and ensuring the well-being of his family. Sports held a special place in his heart, where he found immense joy in supporting his children’s games, bonding over golf with his son and friends, and passionately cheering on the O’s and Raven’s games.</p><p>In addition to his wife, Ken is survived by his son, Scott Brian Merkel, daughter-in-law Chelsea of Glen Burnie, MD; daughter, Lindsey Rae Merkel of Windsor, CO; grandson, Maverick Brian Merkel; brother, Wayne Merkel, sister-in-law Beverly of Westminster, MD; and sister, Joyce Thompson, brother-in-law Walter of Westminster, MD, along with numerous nieces and nephews. Ken was predeceased by his son Stephen John Merkel.</p><p>The sudden departure of Ken leaves an irreplaceable void in the lives of those who loved him. His infectious laughter, unwavering support, and zest for life will be dearly missed. As we mourn his loss, let us celebrate the profound impact Ken had on our lives and hold onto the memories that will forever be etched in our hearts. His legacy of love, laughter, and dedication to family will continue to inspire us as we navigate life without his physical presence.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwrtGimKdlnZq%2FrLHLZqaboaSqrrPFjLCYrZuYqruoec2ermailafApsWMm6mimZ5iuqa%2Byp6jZqCRqHqltcSdZKKmXZius3nAnJqinJWjwXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./arnold-schwarzenegger-never-stopped-loving-maria-shriver-after-the-affair-and-painful-divorce.html><span>←</span><span>Arnold Schwarzenegger never stopped loving Maria Shriver after the affair and painful divorce</span></a>
