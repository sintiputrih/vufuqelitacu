Scottie Pippen’s net worth is roughly $20 Million.</p><p>Scottie Pippen is an American former NBA basketball player who played a total of 17 seasons in the NBA.</p><p>He has won six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls.</p><p>Along with legend <a class=wpil_keyword_link title="Michael Jordan" href=# data-wpil-keyword-link=linked data-lasso-id=93649 data-wpel-link=internal>Michael Jordan</a>, he is known for being one of the best NBA players in history.</p><p>He was named the All-NBA First Team three times.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life></span>Early Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Scotty Maurice Pippen was born on the 25th of September, 1965, in Arkansas.</p><p>Pippen is the youngest child of the 12 children in the family.</p><p>His passion for basketball developed at an early age.</p><p>When he was younger he aspired to make the winning shot in the 7th game of an NBA championship on the same day.</p><p>He attended Hamburg High School where he played for the school basketball team.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before becoming one of the <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/top-20-richest-athletes-world/ data-lasso-id=143402 data-wpel-link=internal><u>richest athletes in the world</u></a>, Scottie Pippen played for the University of Central Arkansas after being discovered as a walk-on.&nbsp;</p><p>While he didn’t receive much media coverage, as a senior he grew to stand 6ft 8 in and averaged 23.6 points per game.&nbsp;</p><p>Pippen’s skills earned him NAIA All-American honors in ‘86 and ‘87, making him the dominant player in the Arkansas Intercollegiate Conference.&nbsp;</p><p>His performance in the Conference earned him the attention of NBA Scouts, which prompted him to join the 1987 Draft.&nbsp;</p><h3>A Professional Rookie</h3><p>During the 1987 NBA Draft, Scottie Pippen was grabbed by the Chicago Bulls, who had been eyeing him since his college days.&nbsp;</p><p>Pippen became part of the Bulls’ young forward duo alongside Horace Grant, and he made his rookie debut in November 1987.&nbsp;</p><p>In his first season, legend <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/michael-jordan-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143403 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Michael Jordan</u></a> served as Pippen’s mentor, and his skills improved dramatically for it, as they played one-on-one outside team practices.&nbsp;</p><p>During the 1988 NBA Playoffs, Pippen took the starting small forward position, helping the Bulls reach the semifinals for the first time in over a decade.&nbsp;</p><p>He continued to improve as the Bulls reached the Eastern Conference finals in ‘89 and ‘90, though they were beaten by the Detroit Pistons.&nbsp;</p><h3>A Rising Star</h3><p>In the 1990-91 NBA season, Pippen became the Bulls’ primary defensive stopper, and he had his first triple-double in November.&nbsp;</p><p>Pippen led the team in blocks per game and was ranked fifth overall in the NBA for steals, earning him NBA All-Defensive Second Team honors.&nbsp;</p><p>With his help, the Chicago Bulls went on to defeat <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/magic-johnson-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143404 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Magic Johnson</u></a> and the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1991 NBA Finals.&nbsp;</p><p>Following this, he went on to help the Bulls achieve their first three-peat, winning the Finals two more times consecutively&nbsp;in ‘92 and ‘93.&nbsp;</p><h3>Moving On Without Jordan&nbsp;</h3><p>Before the 1993-94 season, Michael Jordan retired, and thanks to his absence, Pippen was able to truly shine on his own for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p>During that season, he earned All-Star Game MVP honors and led the Bulls in scoring, assists, and blocks, while being second in the NBA for steals.&nbsp;</p><p>In Game 6, when <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/patrick-ewing-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143405 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Patrick Ewing</u></a> jumped to block his shot, Pippen dunked the ball while taking Ewing’s hand in his face.&nbsp;</p><p>This soon became one of Pippen’s signature career plays and one of the most iconic moments in NBA history.&nbsp;</p><p>Pippen finished the 1994 season leading the Bulls in every category, joining Dave Cowens as one of the few players in history to achieve the feat.&nbsp;</p><h3>A Second Three-Peat</h3><p>With the return of Michael Jordan and the addition of <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/dennis-rodman-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143406 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Dennis Rodman</u></a>, the Bulls were able to post their best regular season record.&nbsp;</p><p>During the 1996-97 season, both Jordan and Pippen were selected to be among the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History.&nbsp;</p><p>The following season ended up becoming the Chicago Bulls’ second three-peat, when they ran the 1998 NBA Finals, besting the Utah Jazz.&nbsp;</p><p>However, that season also proved to be Pippen’s last with the team, as general manager Jerry Krause sought to trade him.&nbsp;</p><h3>Rockets And Trail Blazers</h3><p>After eleven years with the Bulls, Scottie Pippen was traded to the Houston Rockets in January 1999, in exchange for Roy Rogers in a sign-and-trade deal.&nbsp;</p><p>To pay for Pippen, <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/charles-barkley-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143407 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Charles Barkey</u></a> made a lot of sacrifices to grant him an $11 million salary, four times more than his previous salary.&nbsp;</p><p>On the court, Pippen was named to the NBA All-Defensive First-Team for the eighth time and helped the Rockets finish fifth in the Western Conference.&nbsp;</p><p>However, after the season, Pippen requested to be traded, a move Barkley criticized him for, stating he was “disappointed” in the all-star.&nbsp;</p><p>Pippen joined the Portland Trailer Blazers in October 1999 and played for them until 2003, during which time he continued to stand out.&nbsp;</p><h3>Playing With Legends&nbsp;</h3><p>As a member of the Trail Blazers, Scottie Pippen faced off against the All-Star Duo of <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/kobe-bryant-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143408 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Kobe Bryant</u></a> and <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/shaquille-oneal-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=143409 data-wpel-link=internal><u>Shaquille O’Neal</u></a> of the Lakers.&nbsp;</p><p>In his first season, the pair overtook Pippen’s lead to knock the Trail Blazers out of the Finals to become the 2000 NBA Champions.&nbsp;</p><p>The following season, Pippen suffered from tendonitis in his elbow, which required surgery and caused him to struggle on the court.&nbsp;</p><p>When the season was over, he re-signed with the Chicago Bulls for the 2003-04 season, which would be his last.&nbsp;</p><p>Pippen played his final NBA career game against the Seattle SuperSonics in February 2004, and soon after, he announced his retirement.&nbsp;</p><h3>An Executive Comeback</h3><p>While he made a brief comeback with the Finnish league team Torpan Pojat in 2008, in 2010 he returned to the Bulls as a team advisor.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2012, he was named the <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://www.nba.com/bulls/news/pippen-appointed-senior-advisor-president-coo.html data-lasso-id=143410 data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer"><u>Bulls’ senior advisor</u></a> by the team’s president, Michael Reinsdorf, a role that he kept until 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>Now one of the <a href=# data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/richest-nba-players-world/ data-lasso-id=143411 data-wpel-link=internal><u>richest NBA players in the world</u></a>, Pippen is set to appear at the Bulls Ring of Honor event in 2024 alongside Jordan and Rodman.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=scottie-pippen-net-worth></span>Scottie Pippen Net Worth<span

A lot of the players are coming. I wasn’t here when they put (Jackson) up in the rafters. But to have him here as my number goes up, it brings back a lot of great memories.” <strong>– Scottie Pippen</strong></p><p>“He’s very knowledgeable. That’s the one advantage that I see in Kobe Bryant’s career compared to Michael Jordan. Ten years into Kobe Bryant’s career, we’re seeing a very polished 27-year-old player who’s probably got another seven or eight great years ahead of him.” <strong>– Scottie Pippen</strong></p><p>“It’s hard to put it in perspective right now. I’m starting to feel a little emotional about what’s going to happen Friday night. Getting your number put in the rafters is always something that as a kid … you dream of seeing happen to you.” <strong>– Scottie Pippen</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=2-success-lessons-from-scottie-pippen></span>2 Success Lessons From Scottie Pippen<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Now that you know all about Scottie Pippen’s net worth, and how he achieved success; let’s take a look at some of his best lessons that we can learn from him:&nbsp;</p><h3>1.
