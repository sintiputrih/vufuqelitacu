He would accuse her of cheating, but he was doing the cheating. He was the epitome of a gaslighter.”</p><p>Describing her sister as “the most generous person I’ve ever met,” Charene said she had never wanted Patrick for her sister.</p><p>She found out about alleged physical abuse a few weeks before Jenean's death and regrets not being able to save her sister in time.</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>Ryan Hopkins: Man who drove while his friend fatally shot a homeless grandmother outside a California shop gets a year in jail</a></p><p><a href=#>Christina Riggs: Oklahoma nurse who killed her 2 children said 'now I can be with my babies' before execution</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjJyfmqqVo7Jur8eap6aZnmLAorrTopigp12otrTAxKtkqJ5dosKzsMSrnJ1lla16s7vYmqNmmZmZsm62xKecmqZdmLWivMyapWabn6K9or7ErGSapJyatKawjKSgpaSVp3qpwdKbmKecXam8bsDEnWSbrZ6Zxg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mike-schank-passed-away-at-the-age-of-56.html><span>←</span><span>Mike Schank Passed Away At The Age Of 56</span></a>
