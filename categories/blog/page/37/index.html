<a href=../../../../dana-white-wedding-net-worth-ufc-title.html></a>
Dana White believes fate played a big part in his success story.
The UFC CEO, who was recently promoted from UFC president after his company merged with the WWE in a £17billion deal, is not a fan of weddings and he frequently used work as an excuse to skip them in his younger days as he built the juggernaut that is the UFC.
"There was a point in time where I was so focused on where I was going to go in my career,” White explained during an interview with Big Boy.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Doja Cat Previews Bloody &amp;quot;Agora Hills&amp;quot; Music Video, Defends Album Cover</h2><time>Aug 8, 2024</time>
