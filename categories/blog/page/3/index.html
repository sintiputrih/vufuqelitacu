What is the annual NFL referee salary? We originally posted this article in September 2012, when the NFL Referees Association was in the midst of a very bitter and very embarrassing lockout with the National Football League. The lockout forced the NFL to call in replacement refs for several months of the 2012-2013 season. The replacement refs turned out to be a disaster. One particularly embarrassing incident occurred during a game against the Green Bay Packers and the Seattle Seahawks when one of the replacement refs blew what might go down as the worst call in sports history.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Rich Dollaz - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Nationality, Facts</h2><time>Oct 6, 2024</time>

Since then demand for higher capacity has pushed the industry to store more bits in each flash memory cell.
In the past year, the deployment of 64-layer 3D NAND flash has allowed almost all of the SSD industry to adopt three bit per cell TLC flash, which only a few short years ago was the cutting edge.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Sami Sheen: Charlie Sheen, Denise Richards Daughter's Ups, Downs</h2><time>Oct 5, 2024</time>
