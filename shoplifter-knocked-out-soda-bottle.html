They are holding what appears to be a two liter soda bottle above their head in a two handed position.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Unfortunately, the store will probably get sued 😩</p>— Clint McCain (@Clint_McCain) <a href=#>October 31, 2023</a> <span>Source: X | @Clint_McCain</span></figure><p>They take one step forward and let the soda bottle go and with surgical accuracy, the bottle launches from their hands and smacks the alleged criminal right in the face, a hit that they don't see coming.</p><p>The blow appears to shut the thief's lights out. They go limp and tumble to the ground as if they took a powerful hook from Francis Ngannou that they didn't see coming.</p><p>The crook folds like an accordion to the ground, unmoving, as the security guard steps above them and puts them on their back, placing their arms to their sides.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>That was an ax throw right there that person has a bright future on the professional ax throwing circuit</p>— joseph breaux (@josephbrea20983) <a href=#>October 31, 2023</a> <span>Source: X | @josephbrea20983</span></figure><p>Replies to the platform on both X and Reddit were multifarious, with several people offering words of praise for the man in the red sweater for intervening and taking the shoplifter out with the bottle of soda.</p><p>"That was beautiful," one person wrote.</p><p>"This should be an Olympic event," an X user penned.</p><p>"To defeat threats, bravery becomes our greatest weapon.

If it was just a random customer, the guy who copped the bottle to the head will have to identify him in order to sue him.
