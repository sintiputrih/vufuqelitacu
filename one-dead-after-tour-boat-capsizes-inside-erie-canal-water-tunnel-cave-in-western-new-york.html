A boat carrying hospitality workers capsized today during a tour of a historic underground cavern system,killing one person who became trapped beneath the overturned vessel, officials said.
All 29 people on board the flat-bottomed boat operated by Lockport Cave Tours were thrown into water between about 1.8 metres deep deep when the craft tipped over towards the end of the roughly 90m route."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Rescue crews using an inflatable boat rescued about 16 others, Lockport fire chief Luca Quagliano said.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Jeremy Swiatowy, 42, watched as rescue workers breached the wall to the tunnel with a sledgehammer before shimmying through the hole to reach people inside.</p><p>“The water in the caves is super cold,” he said.</p><p>When rescuers reached the boat, some passengers had climbed on top of its upturned hull, Quagliano said at a news conference.</p><p>Authorities did not immediately release the name of the man who died.

The agency organised the outing as part of a familiarisation tour, she said.</p><p>Authorities said the specially built motorboat holds up to 40 people, who sit in rows about four across. During the ride, about 60-90cm of space separate the boat and cave walls on either side.</p><p>Nobody on board had a life preserver, authorities said. It was unclear whether they were required or offered.</p><p>The company that operates the tours did not immediately respond to phone calls and an email seeking comment.</p><p>Lockport Mayor Michelle Roman said the attraction, about 32km northeast of Niagara Falls, has operated since the mid-1970s without incident. It will remain closed during an investigation.</p><p>“This is very sad for everybody,” she said.</p><p>Police chief Steven Abbott said the cave and canal are private property.</p><p>“We have a lot of questions that need to be answered,” he said.</p><p>Video footage from outside the Lockport Cave office showed one person talking as she was loaded onto an ambulance. Others wrapped in white towels were being escorted to a bus as a steady rain fell.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The water tunnel was once the subject of an episode of the Syfy network show <i>Ghost Hunters</i>.</p><p><b>- AP</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmsKeiobFwu82eZJ2dkZl6orLTnqlmrJ%2Bqv26uzpqrZpuRpcCqxsSsZKKmo56xpnnEq6CeZZOWu6K4jLCYrZ2iYsG2us2eo2abkauybrXNZq6eq6Sav695zZ6uZrGfp7hwjrl9inBtY3ilh5Onk3uLgnmPkJicoHyGkXlf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heidi-klum-husband-tom-kaulitz-goes-above-and-beyond-daddy-duties-home-video.html><span>←</span><span>Heidi Klum's husband goes above and beyond for 'daddy' duties in home video you can't miss</span></a>
