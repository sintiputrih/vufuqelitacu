Back then, the&nbsp;McDonald’s brand was little more than a modest&nbsp;diner, but Kroc sensed franchise potential, eventually going on to construct one of the biggest companies in the land.</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>Now that TWC’s marketing push has taken into effect, Deadline brings forth the first clip for The Founder, which features Keaton’s protagonist dolling out some wisdom regarding those famous Golden Arches:&nbsp;“They signify family, it signifies community. It’s a place where Americans come together to break bread.”</p><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=792 data-injectable=true>Also starring Laura Dern as Ray Kroc’s wife Ethel Fleming, The Founder looks to be a sharp, entertaining account of one man’s pursuit of the American Dream. Whether it’s enough to place Michael Keaton’s name in the running for Oscar season for a third consecutive year is another question – after Birdman and Spotlight, that is – but we’ll be keeping track of Hancock’s true-life drama as its theatrical release draws near.</p><p data-characters=111 data-current-count=111 data-injectable=false><strong>The Founder</strong> has been screening in select theaters since&nbsp;December 7, and will expand nationwide on&nbsp;January 20.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXZy8rbDEp2SaqpOdsrR5zp9kppuUpLuiuMOsZJqqlWK%2ForXSnptmoZ5is6q%2B0q1knKSZpXqnu9Fmq6GdXZu8trrDnqlo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./snootie-wild-a-memphis-rapper-passed-away-at-the-age-of-36.html><span>←</span><span>Snootie Wild A Memphis Rapper Passed Away At The Age Of 36</span></a>
