It's good ol’ scrunchie! It is no secret the scrunchie has made a massive comeback this year and it is no longer used for just making beautiful hairstyles. It can be worn as bracelets and several celebrities have been spotted jumping on this trend.</span></p><p><span>The modern scrunchie is everything and more; you may refer to it as the 90's pro max. These hair ties are made of high-quality materials that have great textures, are shiny, stretchable, and comfortable. They are lightweight and easy to wear and are safe to use on your delicate hair.</span></p><p><span>However, getting the wrong kind greatly damages your hair. You don't want that, no one wants that! We have given some tips below on how to know the best type of scrunchie for you.</span></p><h3>What Are the Best Types of Scrunchie Materials?</h3><h4><b>Silk</b></h4><p><span>Scrunchies made of silk are some of the best scrunchies in the market. Silk has a smooth texture and it is completely natural. Using a <a href=#>silk scrunchie</a> on your hair not only helps you to create beautiful hairstyles, but it also prevents dizziness and protects your hair from tangling and breakage.</span></p><p><span>This type of material is best suited to a dry hair type that is prone to breakage. If you have hair such as this, then you may want to consider buying scrunchies that are made of silk.</span></p><h3>How Do I Clean My Silk Scrunchie?</h3><p><span>Brand new scrunchies made of silk are lovely and smooth. But, they do get dirty from the grease in your hair and they won’t look as pretty when dirty. You need to wash them often to prevent them from creasing.</span></p><p><span>To ensure that they retain their silky texture, use a tiny amount of shampoo, rub the <a href=#>silk scrunchie</a> in your hand gently to get rid of the dirt, rinse with cold or warm water, and air dry.</span></p><p><span>Do not use a laundry machine to wash them. After air drying, do not just shove them into a drawer, ensure that you hand them on doorknobs or store them in a place where there's plenty of room for the scrunchie to still retain its shape without creasing.</span></p><h4><b>Velvet</b></h4><p><span>Velvet is a lightweight, soft material that is very gentle on your hair. Scrunchies made with velvet allow your hair to be worn in any style without pulling or damaging your hair.</span></p><p><span>The lightweight material of a velvet scrunchie allows the tie to slide over your hair instead of pulling hence, preventing damage.&nbsp; Hair pulling could cause a receding hairline, hair loss, and thinning.</span></p><p><span>Scrunchies made with this material are usually best suited for long and thick hair types. However, they can still be used for any hair type and length.</span></p><h3>How Do I Clean My Velvet Scrunchie?</h3><p><span>Velvet scrunchies can get dirty easily from sweat or hair grease and if you don’t want them to look like a dirty old rag, you may want to consider washing them when they get dirty.</span></p><p><span>While some material of scrunchies can be thrown into the washing to be washed on a delicate cycle, some however should only be hand washed. Velvet scrunchie is the latter.</span></p><p><span>You can wash your velvet scrunchie with warm water and a few drops of shampoo or fabric softener. Gently rub your velvet scrunchie by hand until it is clean, and then rinse with clean cold, or lukewarm water. Make sure that you air dry to ensure that it retains its original shape.</span></p><h4><b>Cotton</b></h4><p><span>These are the most popular scrunchies in the market. Because of the natural fiber, people often think that it is the best option. If you have dry hair, you may want to stay away from scrunchies made from cotton.</span></p><p><span>Cotton is a fabric that absorbs quickly and sucks out the moisture out of your hair leaving it dry and dehydrated. Dry hair is more likely to break and get damaged.</span></p><p><span>If you must use cotton scrunchies, avoid the ones with a really tight elastic band. Tighter elastic bands than usual could cause tugging and pull of hair which could cause hair loss or receding hairline.</span></p><h3>How Do I Clean My Cotton Scrunchie?</h3><p><span>A cotton scrunchie can be cleaned in a laundry machine at a delicate cycle or your normal routine wash mode. It should be washed with cold water and air-dried to avoid creasing.</span></p><h4><b>Satin</b></h4><p><span>Satin isn't a natural fiber, as it is made from a synthetic weave. Scrunchies made with satin usually appear glossy and shiny. It is anti-absorbent and can be slippery on hair.</span></p><p><span>Satin scrunchies are more likely to glide off and lose their grip after a few uses. Some of them are prone to thread pulls, snags, and abrasions of their surfaces. These scrunchies can absorb heat and are suitable for all kinds of hair types and lengths.</span></p><h3>How Can I Clean My Satin Scrunchie?</h3><p><span>These types of scrunchie should only be hand washed with warm water, and shampoo or very mild detergent. After washing, they should be laid out to dry&nbsp;</span></p><h4><b>Chiffon</b></h4><p><span>Scrunchies made from chiffon are incredibly lightweight and soft. They have a good texture, are comfortable, and are quite stretchy. These types of scrunchies will not hurt your hair. They are easy to wear and would not slip or slide off your hair.</span></p><h3>How Do I Clean My Chiffon Scrunchie?</h3><p><span>Chiffon scrunchies should be hand washed with cold water and a few drops of shampoo. It should be air-dried and kept in a safe place because of its delicate material.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGipnq6ZmsRwrcKcnKyrn6e2pr%2BOrJqrrZ6Ytaqxjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./734311-meek-mill-reacts-rick-ross-too-good-to-be-true-sales.html><span>←</span><span>Meek Mill Reacts To Rick Ross Collab, &amp;quot;Too Good To Be True,&amp;quot; 1st Week Sales</span></a>
