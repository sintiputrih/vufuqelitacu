<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Britney Spears Still Crushing on Brad Pitt, Happy Hes Single</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Still got it bad for Brad! <b>Britney Spears</b> commented on her unremitting love for <b>Brad Pitt</b> during a recent segment on Australia’s <i>Today Show</i> — and she is totally aware that the <i>Fight Club</i> star, 52, is back on the market following <a href=#>his split from <b>Angelina Jolie</b></a><b></b>.</p><p>The pop princess, 34, played a round of Question Roulette for the pretaped appearance. The first query thrown her way? “First celebrity crush?”</p><p>“My first celebrity crush was Brad Pitt,” she said with a big smile. “He’s single now!”</p><p>As the Britney Army is well aware, the “Make Me …” singer has never been shy about expressing her affection for Pitt. She’s been name-dropping the eternal heartthrob in interviews since the start of her career as a teen in the late ’90s.</p><p>During a 2003 interview with <b>Diane Sawyer</b>, a then-21-year-old Spears became flustered when asked about her prized photo with the hunky actor that was once proudly displayed on her nightstand. “We shouldn’t share that. I’m embarrassed,” she said at the time. “That’s my little thing!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/britney-spears-inline-7bfb53a1-514f-4d6e-a225-5bc03c45e985.jpg><p>And in 2005, as documented on her short-lived reality show, <i>Britney and Kevin: Chaotic</i>, Spears excitedly spoke out about Pitt’s divorce from <b>Jennifer Aniston </b>— before he and Jolie, now 41, went public with their romance.</p><p>“We found out that Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt broke up. So I have a feeling that he’s thinking about me. … Just playing,” she told the camera, as her now-ex-husband <b>Kevin Federline</b> sat beside her and listened. “He probably wouldn’t even look my way. I don’t care, ’cause we can dream. We can dream!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-7e94feb8-d32a-40e2-82f7-7796f6d197a6.jpg><p>“Have you seen Brad Pitt in <i>Fight Club</i>? That is Brad Ass Pitt,” she told K-Fed — with whom she shares sons Sean Preston, 11, and Jayden James, 10 — before assuring him, “I wouldn’t leave you for him, anyway, because it’s a dream, not reality.”</p><p>Though Spears — who pulled the plug on her relationship with Federline, now 38, in November 2006 after two years of marriage — can’t deny her undying devotion to Pitt, she said she feels fine on her own during an October 4 appearance on the U.K.’s <i>Loose Women</i>. “I’m happily single right now,” she shared.</p><p>After calling it quits with Federline, she was engaged to Hollywood agent <b>Jason Trawick</b>, but the pair broke it off in 2013. She then went on to date <b>David Lucado</b> and producer <b>Charlie Ebersol</b>.</p><span class=caption></span><p>For Pitt’s part, a source previously told <i>Us Weekly</i> that <a href=#>he is “a shattered man” after Jolie filed for divorce </a>on Monday, September 19, citing irreconcilable differences.</p><p>“He is beside himself and has been crying,” the insider told <i>Us</i>. “He was completely caught off guard and blindsided and had no idea she would do this.”</p><p>Watch Spears gush over Pitt in the video above.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpmpu6bFjKynnpmiqHq0wMilo2aboqrAqbXNoGSopl2Xv6KwjKmgraxdna6xvNhmn56rXai2r7PLnmSwbGRog3mDjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./are-mark-leiter-and-al-leiter-related-know-about-the-baseball-players-family-tree-416491-html.html><span>←</span><span>Are Mark Leiter And Al Leiter Related?
