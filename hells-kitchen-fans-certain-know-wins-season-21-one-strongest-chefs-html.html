He moved to a take-out model during the pandemic before reopening at a limited capacity. But by July 2021, Belew said he felt “stuck” and “highly bored creatively.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_75>“I wasn’t happy and was missing the excitement of the line, my team, changing my menu, and serving guests,” he told the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nashville Voyager</a> in November 2022. “I saw an application for Hell’s Kitchen on [Facebook] and sent mine in. After [five] months of Zooms, appointments, psychological exams, and waiting, I got the call that I was chosen to be on the show on December 23. And now we all wait to see what happens!”</p><p id=par-14_63>Belew shared what makes him different from the other contestants on the show. “One thing that sets me apart from others is my constant search for knowledge,” he said. “I love going and staging at other restaurants with great chefs and teams and learning their techniques and methods. The more well-rounded you are, the more you can handle anything that’s thrown at you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1prjLrGSkoaSYtaa6jJ%2BYp6tdmLKzwMCipWajnqTEbsPIp6pmq5WWwLC6jGtoZqeemnq0wNGopaCdo6l6pLTEn6pnoKSiuXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicolette-ann-mendoza-catalan-19880302-html.html><span>←</span><span>Nicolette Ann Mendoza-Catalan (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Heigh</span></a>
