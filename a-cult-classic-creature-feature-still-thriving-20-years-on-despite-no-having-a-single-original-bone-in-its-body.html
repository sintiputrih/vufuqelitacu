In fact, it was a marked disappointment all-round after earning a disappointing $45 million at the box office on a $30 million budget, while respective Rotten Tomatoes scores of 47 and 33 percent from critics and crowds didn’t even elevate the film into “so bad it’s actually kinda good” territory.</p><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=true>Instead, it’s been left to lurk in the background to spin a web of cult classic adulation, something that’s been proven as a worthwhile exercise based on the response to a celebratory <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit </a>thread. Eight Legged Freaks isn’t good, but it definitely does possess some entertainment factor if you’re in the mood for watching the inevitable shenanigans that follow a chemical spill mutating regular-sized spiders into hulking beasts with nothing but death on their mind.</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=178 data-injectable=false>Obviously, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Arachnophobia is right there if you want an identical adventure that’s genuinely great</a>, but Eight Legged Freaks does tick all of the exact same boxes regardless.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomGabpaHBbq%2FLmqqsoZNisLOxwK2sq51dm7KiwNSrnGarpJ65rXnToamirpmjtG5%2Bj2awnpmiqHqwuoydnKyomamybrrOZp%2BarpmjtG6tjKygp5%2BcmnqwvsigoKeZnGKvsLrEZqCnZZmpwG6uzp2waA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-bieber-hiding-in-his-drop-crotch-pants-html.html><span>←</span><span>What Is Justin Bieber Hiding in His Drop-Crotch Pants?</span></a>
