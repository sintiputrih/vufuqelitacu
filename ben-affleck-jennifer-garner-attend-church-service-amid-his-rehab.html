Adds the source: “He feels really bad and sorry about doing this because of the kids.” (The pair are parents to daughters Violet, 12, and Seraphina, 9, and son Samuel, 6.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MEGA284088_027.jpg><p>A second source added that getting help “is all that matters to him right now,” and that “Ben is not shy about his issues around addiction, particularly since he made that conversation public.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Days before entering treatment, Affleck and Saturday Night Live producer <strong>Lindsay Shookus</strong> <a href=#>split after more than a year together</a>.
