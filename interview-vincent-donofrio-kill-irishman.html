Leonard “Gomer Pyle” Lawrence in <strong>Full Metal Jacket</strong>, Edgar, the evil bug in <strong>Men in Black</strong> and Detective Robert Goren from <strong>Law & Order: Criminal Intent</strong>.</p><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>This past week, D’Onofrio took some time to talk to us about his most recent film, <strong><a href=#>Kill The Irishman</a></strong>, in which he stars alongside <strong>Ray Stevenson</strong>, <strong>Val Kilmer </strong>and <strong>Christopher Walken</strong>.</p><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=185 data-injectable=false><strong>Jonathan Hensleigh </strong>(2004’s <strong>The Punisher</strong>) directs this crime drama, which is based on the true story of <strong>Danny Greene</strong> (Stevenson), an Irish thug working for mobsters in 1970s Cleveland.</p><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false>Read on to see what D’Onofrio has to say about his training and&nbsp;preparation&nbsp;for the role, how he enjoyed working with Stevenson, Kilmer and Walken and what his plans for the future are.</p><p data-characters=56 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true><strong>We Got This Covered</strong>: So what is <strong>Kill The Irishman </strong>about?</p><p data-characters=488 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true><strong>Vincent D’Onofrio</strong>: <strong>Kill the Irishman</strong> is about a guy named Danny Greene, who started in the unions in Cleveland. He kind of took over. He kind of cornered the market there, and then got involved with the mob. He then took things into his own hands and this started a war. It took a long time for them to get rid of Danny Greene, but, eventually, they did. He’s kind of the first guy going up against the mob, and especially being an Irishman. He kind of formed into a tall tale figure.</p><p data-characters=41 data-current-count=41 data-injectable=false><strong>WGTC</strong>: Who is your character in the movie?</p><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=188 data-injectable=false><strong>Vincent D’Onofrio</strong>: I play John Nardi, the guy who crossed over from the mob to help Danny Greene organize and start his own underground activity.</p><p data-characters=67 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false><strong>WGTC</strong>: How much training and preparation did you put into this role?</p><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=740 data-injectable=true><strong>Vincent D’Onofrio</strong>: I researched Danny Greene. There weren’t a lot of pictures of John Nardi. There was just one photo, and so I had to kind of use my imagination and think of myself as the character of the story that we’re telling in the film, not what you might call the “real story of what happened.” But <strong>Jonathan Hensleigh</strong>, the writer and director of this film, wanted to give the story that he wanted to tell. I just, in my way, kind of prepared as an actor to play John.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/mmm-607x360.jpg width=607 height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=101 data-injectable=false><strong>WGTC</strong>: Had you known about this story or read the book on which it’s based before tackling the role?</p><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false><strong>Vincent D’Onofrio</strong>: I didn’t know about Danny Greene, no. I was quite amazed by the whole thing. He was quite a figure. It was cool to research his story and the people around him. I found it very interesting.</p><p data-characters=74 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false><strong>WGTC</strong>: How was it like working with <strong>Ray Stevenson</strong> and the rest of the cast?</p><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=887 data-injectable=true><strong>Vincent D’Onofrio</strong>: I loved it. A lot of them I’ve worked before. They’re all great guys. Ray, especially, is a great guy. I had a great time. We all had a great time. I’ve known Val for a long time and it’s always good to see him. It’s just good, you know. When you’re having a good time on the set, you, sometimes, think the film is going to turn out bad since you’re having a good time. But, in this case, the film turned out pretty good. I had a good time, and we made a good film.</p><p data-characters=80 data-current-count=80 data-injectable=false><strong>WGTC</strong>: Had you worked with <strong>Jonathan Hensleigh</strong> before, or is this your first time?</p><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=208 data-injectable=false><strong>Vincent D’Onofrio</strong>: It was the first time, yeah. Jonathan and I have remained friends since the film. We got along pretty well.</p><p data-characters=88 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false><strong>WGTC</strong>: Do you have any more crime or mafia related films coming up as your next projects?</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true><strong>Vincent D’Onofrio</strong>: I did a film called <strong>Fire with Fire</strong>. I just finished that a few weeks ago. I play an Aryan leader in that, but that and my character in <strong>Kill the Irishman</strong>&nbsp;are&nbsp;the only kind of so-called corrupt people I’ve played lately.</p><p data-characters=35 data-current-count=35 data-injectable=false><strong>WGTC</strong>: What is <strong>Fire With Fire</strong> about?</p><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true><strong>Vincent D’Onofrio</strong>: It’s kind of a thriller/action film we shot in New Orleans with a director named <strong>David Barret</strong>, who I liked a lot. <strong>Bruce Willis</strong> is in it. Hopefully, it’s really good. I hadn’t done anything like that for a long time, because I was on television for so long with <strong>Criminal Intent</strong>. It was interesting to pick up an action type movie after the show was over. I really had a good time.</p><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>And what I mean by when the show was over, I don’t mean doing movies like they were before I started the show, but shooting at a much faster pace and shorter amount of time. Your daily work schedule is heavier and there’s no more sitting around anymore, which I like a lot. It was kind of nice to go back and go into an action film and be working every day on it and getting it done. I really enjoyed it.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/vincent-donofrio.jpg width=504 height=314 sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=85 data-current-count=85 data-injectable=false><strong>WGTC</strong>: With <strong>Criminal Intent</strong> being over, do you have any plans to return to television?</p><p data-characters=103 data-current-count=188 data-injectable=false><strong>Vincent D’Onofrio</strong>: Yes, I’m doing a new show for NBC called <strong>Blue Tilt</strong>, with <strong>Ethan Hawke</strong> and myself.</p><p data-characters=53 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false><strong>WGTC: </strong>Is it another cop drama or something different?</p><p data-characters=103 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false><strong>Vincent D’Onofrio</strong>: It’s a detective show, but it’s not just about crime. It’s about family too.</p><p data-characters=66 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true><strong>WGTC</strong>: How does it feel to be a part of the <strong>Law & Order</strong> legacy?</p><p data-characters=580 data-current-count=580 data-injectable=true><strong>Vincent D’Onofrio</strong>: It was good. I learned a lot from <strong>Dick Wolf</strong>. I’ll always remember playing that character because it was such a good character. It was great to be able to be a character like that for television. I think the thing that I’ll bring from the whole experience, the whole 10 years, is I had never been interested in the television business before. As the years went on, I became more interested in it and I learned so much about it. I think, in the end, that will be the thing I bring from it the most. I learned so much about how the television business works.</p><p data-characters=62 data-current-count=62 data-injectable=false><strong>WGTC</strong>: So <strong>Law & Order</strong> was your first television experience?</p><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false><strong>Vincent D’Onofrio</strong>: Early in my career, I had done about two other shows on television and then there was the brief role I did in <strong>Homicide: Life on the Street</strong>. That was it. I had never been a regular on a show before. I spent most of my career doing theater and films.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false><a href=#><img decoding=async title="irishman vincent d'onofrio 2" alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/irishman-vincent-donofrio-2.jpg width=560 height=323 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p data-characters=135 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=true><strong>WGTC</strong>: That’s about all I have, unless you have something you would like to add about <strong>Kill the Irishman</strong> or any of your other projects.</p><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false><strong>Vincent D’Onofrio</strong>: I think that <strong>Kill the Irishman</strong> is a very good movie, and it’s about an interesting subject. As far as what I’ve done, I have my first feature that I co-wrote and directed coming up in December called <strong>Don’t Go in the Woods</strong>. It’s being released by <strong>Tribeca Films</strong>. It’s a horror musical. <strong>Tribeca Films </strong>loves it, and we start doing a press tour for it next month.</p><p data-characters=26 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true><strong>WGTC</strong>: Who is in the movie?</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false><strong>Vincent D’Onofrio</strong>: I cast it off the streets of New York, all unknown actors. I just wanted people who could sing and have never acted before. It’s perfect. I used no casting director and just went into my hometown, New York City, and just found them.</p><p data-characters=102 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>This concludes our interview, but we would like to thank Vincent for taking the time to speak with us.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKeslafDqrHWZq2ippOau7V5w6ilqJ6inrxut8ilo2ahop7AqbnAp2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brother-of-john-legend.html><span>←</span><span>Brother of John Legend Fresher Post</span></a>
