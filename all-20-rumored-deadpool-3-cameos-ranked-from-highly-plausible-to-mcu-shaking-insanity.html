And it’s name is <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadpool 3</a></strong>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=498 data-current-count=498 data-injectable=true>At the time of writing, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a whopping total of 20 familiar faces</a> have been rumored in some shape or form to be featured in Ryan Reynolds’ long-awaited MCU debut, which also memorably brings back Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. These claimed cameos vary wildly from legacy X-Men stars to old pals of Reynolds’ to bonafide superstars. You might be inclined to disbelieve all of them, but even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">director Shawn Levy has admitted</a> that at least some of the reported guest stars are bang on the money.</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>The only officially announced cameo at this point is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Garner’s Elektra</a>, so that just goes to show how literally anything can happen with this movie. With that in mind, here’s every supposed Deadpool 3 cameo, ranked from those that are all but confirmed to those that are so crazy they might just work.</p><h2 id=h-20-patrick-stewart-as-professor-x data-injectable=false>20. Patrick Stewart as Professor X</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/professor-x-e1676583486876.png><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>A cameo from the X-Men leader with the big brain is surely a no-brainer, yes? Sir Patrick Stewart’s already broken his MCU cherry with Doctor Strange 2 and, as an 83-year-old veteran of the Marvel and Star Trek universes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who is so done keeping secrets</a>, he’s also kind of admitted he’s in Deadpool 3 anyway.</p><h2 id=h-19-ian-mckellen-as-magneto data-injectable=false>19. Ian McKellen as Magneto</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ban-15.jpg><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>Sir Pat Stew is so done with keeping secrets, in fact, that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he’s also strongly intimated</a> that his off-screen bestie/on-screen frenemy Ian McKellen could be returning alongside him in Deadpool 3. McKellen has never been shy about reprising his own franchise roles, so this one feels like another cert.</p><h2 id=h-18-halle-berry-as-storm data-injectable=false>18. Halle Berry as Storm</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/storm-x-men-e1668020910399.jpg><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>There are different ways of spoiling your own surprise Marvel cameos. You can get candid about it in an interview or you can really try your best to give Kevin Feige a coronary by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sharing a stylish selfie on social media</a> in which you rock a very familiar hairstyle. That’s the route Halle Berry took anyway.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>17. Rebecca Romijn as Mystique</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Rebeca-Romijn-Mystique-X-Men.jpg><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>Rebecca Romijn returning as Mystique? Sure, why not? She already came back for a cameo in X-Men: First Class. Plus, blue-ing her up is probably a lot easier these days as it’d no doubt all be done with CGI. If DP3 can recreate Erik and Raven’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“being bitchy in the back of the school bus”</a> routine from X2 I’ll be eternally grateful.</p><h2 id=h-16-james-marsden-as-cyclops data-injectable=false>16. James Marsden as Cyclops</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cyclops-x-men-marsden-e1680713902516.jpg><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>If any of Fox’s OG X-Men needs another crack at the whip it’s James Marsden’s perfectly cast, totally underused Scott Summers. Marsden is such a talented and funny actor that you know he’d make the most of getting to give Cyclops some personality over than <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his nth take on a cuckolded spouse</a>.</p><h2 id=h-15-famke-janssen-as-jean-grey data-injectable=false>15. Famke Janssen as Jean Grey</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/b178f2b8f58411eab5c010ddb1aba44f.jpg><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>After Dark Phoenix was, well, Dark Phoenix, the entire X-Men community collectively agreed they didn’t want more Jean Grey on our screens for another decade at least, but I think we can make an exception for Famke Janssen’s OG Jean. Sorry, Sophie Turner.</p><h2 id=h-14-owen-wilson-as-mobius data-injectable=false>14. Owen Wilson as Mobius</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Owen-Wilson-Mobius-Loki-Season-2-1.png><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadpool 3 set pics</a> have confirmed the Time Variance Authority will have some presence in the movie, so it only adds up that the TVA’s poster boy Mobius M. Mobius will drop by to chase down Wade Wilson. It’s just bizarre that it’s taken Ryan Reynolds and Owen Wilson this long to share the big screen.</p><h2 id=h-13-tara-strong-as-miss-minutes data-injectable=false>13. Tara Strong as Miss Minutes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Miss-Minutes-1.jpg><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>If Mobius is the TVA’s poster boy, then Miss Minutes is the organization’s mascot, so Tara Strong’s Texan-accented cartoon clock is surely set to pop up in Deadpool 3 somewhere. We know that she works directly with Kang, thanks to the Loki season 1 finale, so her inclusion may even tease the Conqueror’s own involvement.</p><h2 id=h-12-walker-scobell-as-kidpool data-injectable=false>12. Walker Scobell as Kidpool</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/image1-22.jpg><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>Walker Scobell being in this movie would hardly be surprising, as Deadpool 3 is practically an Adam Project family reunion at this point. The teen actor turning up as Kidpool would be a little out of left field, though, as no other Deadpool variants have been rumored at this stage but, hey, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this is what Reynolds himself has hinted at</a>.</p><h2 id=h-11-brian-cox-as-general-stryker data-injectable=false>11. Brian Cox as General Stryker</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/X-Men_Stryker.jpg><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false>Brian Cox returning as General Stryker after over 20 years feels infinitely bizarre and unlikely at first glance until you consider the fact that bringing him on board for a cameo would allow Deadpool to drop a Succession reference. There’s no way Reynolds will be able to resist a “Logan vs. Logan Roy” gag.</p><h2 id=h-10-dafne-keen-as-x-23 data-injectable=false>10. Dafne Keen as X-23</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/his-dark-materials-e1665164997775.jpg><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>If Marvel was smart they wouldn’t just bring Dafne Keen (who first played Laura in Logan) back as Logan’s clone daughter X-23 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">for a mere cameo</a>, but sign her up for a multi-movie deal now and make her the new Wolverine in the MCU. You can have that advice for free, Kevin, but next time I want 10%.</p><h2 id=h-9-channing-tatum-as-gambit data-injectable=false>9. Channing Tatum as Gambit</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Channing-Tatum-Dog-1-e1694778653997.jpg><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>Channing Tatum cameod in Free Guy, so the idea of him reuniting with Reynolds and Levy in Deadpool 3 is surely too delicious to pass up. Plus, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this guy has been desperate to play Gambit</a> for so long that he’s kind of earned it. After all this time, though, his Cajun accent had better be up to snuff.</p><h2 id=h-8-lewis-tan-as-shatterstar data-injectable=false>8. Lewis Tan as Shatterstar</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lewis-tan-shatterstar-1.png><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>I’d love to be a fly on the wall of Marvel HQ when this cameo came up. “Forget Jackman and the rest of the beloved franchise veterans,” one exec must have said. “What about the dude from Mortal Kombat who turned up as a red-headed alien for two minutes in Deadpool 2?” It truly is the House of Ideas.</p><h2 id=h-7-ben-affleck-as-daredevil data-injectable=false>7. Ben Affleck as Daredevil</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/affleck-dd.jpg><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>George Clooney returning as Batman was something we never thought we’d see, but Ben Affleck back as Daredevil?! Hey, Affleck’s life has been resetting to how it was 20 years ago lately, what with him getting back together with J-Lo. If this cameo happens, presumably we can next expect Gigli 2.</p><h2 id=h-6-tom-hiddleston-as-loki data-injectable=false>6. Tom Hiddleston as Loki</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/loki-season-2-teaser-tom-hiddleston.jpg><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=142 data-injectable=false>Tired: Deadpool should team up with Spider-Man. Wired: Deadpool should make some mischief with Loki. As Stan Lee would say, ’nuff said.</p><h2 id=h-5-elizabeth-olsen-as-scarlet-witch data-injectable=false>5. Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Elizabeth-Olsen-as-Scarlet-Witch-in-Doctor-Strange-in-the-Multiverse-of-Madness-2.png><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>Scarlet Witch returning from the dead, after a dark and villainous arc in which she lost her husband and children and attempted to murder an adolescent, for a quick cameo in which she trades quips with Deadpool? Yeah, OK, let’s do it.</p><h2 id=h-4-julian-mcmahon-as-doctor-doom data-injectable=false>4. Julian McMahon as Doctor Doom</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Doctor-Doom-Fantastic-Four-2005-1-e1691495073561.jpeg><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>Yes, as it stands no one else from the original Fantastic Four movies is directly linked to DP3, apart from Julian McMahon’s Doctor Doom. It comes to something when the guy from Charmed remains the definitive cinematic incarnation of Doom after 60 years.</p><h2 id=h-3-taron-egerton-as-wolverine data-injectable=false>3. Taron Egerton as Wolverine</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tetris-taron-egerton-henk-rogers.png><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>John Krasinski getting cast as Reed Richards really started something, huh? Now, any popular fan cast could come true, thanks to the wonderful cameo-creating powers of the multiverse. Taron Egerton as Wolverine full-time? Not gonna happen. As Wolverine for three seconds? Maybe.</p><h2 id=h-2-daniel-radcliffe-as-wolverine data-injectable=false>2. Daniel Radcliffe as Wolverine (?)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Daniel-Radcliffe-e1693504241535.png><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=297 data-injectable=false>To be clear, Daniel Radcliffe is only rumored to have been cast in a “secret role” in Deadpool 3, but with the entire internet wanting him as Wolverine (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">especially after his recent body transformation</a>) who else would he be playing? <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Glob Herman</a>? Actually, wait, now I want to see that.</p><h2 id=h-1-taylor-swift-as-dazzler data-injectable=false>1. Taylor Swift as Dazzler</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Taylor-Swift-Watcher-Multiverse.jpg><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>If this was any other movie we were talking about, there’s no way this would be real. But Deadpool 3? You could tell me the film ends with the X-Men coming together to sing “Shake It Off” like Kermit and friends crooning “Rainbow Connection” in The Muppet Movie and I’d half-believe you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKWkXWd9br7UpqarnZRisaatw6mmqKRdaHqkrcyepqxlopa7rLHDZp2rp51itaqzx6WwZqiclsK0tcGlnGasn2K6pMGMrJ%2Bao5mjtG61zayYp6Gkrnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./msi-launches-optix-mag272crx-27-inch-curved-240hz.html><span>←</span><span>A 27-Inch, 240Hz Curved Monitor with USB-C</span></a>
