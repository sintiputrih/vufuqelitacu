I mean, look at me! But fitting in was never something I really worried about because I knew early on I was born to stand out. So, I did my own thing and ignored anyone who wanted me to conform. Embracing my oddities, snakes and all, has taken me far. From the Super Bowl to this very stage. That's right! Technically, I've been here before. But this time, I'm here to compete, and The Masked Singer feels like the perfect stage for me because honestly? Look around. It doesn't get much weirded than this."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>The clue package also contained the following clues:</p><ul><li>A chess board</li><li>A tattoo of a flaming heart with the words "True Love" on it</li><li>A set of scales with a picture of Buckingham Palace on one side and what looks to be an old-fashioned car (or maybe a carriage) on the other</li><li>One of Medusa's snakes spitting out black venom</li><li>Saturn</li></ul><p>Medusa's Swag Bag Clue was a DVD box for Medusa: Snakes on the Astral Plane with a note saying "$340 million sold!" Medusa then said "Sometimes, success comes in the grayest of places."</p><p>Clues from Episode 2 included:</p><ul><li>A portrait of Coldplay lead singer <a href=#>Chris Martin</a></li><li>A First Class ticket with Flight 1996 to Tokyo</li><li>A picture of four palm trees</li></ul><p>Medusa also said, "I've taken a tour of the world and I love it. Wanna know where I'm from? Take a little look closer."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Adele (@adele)</a></p></figure><p>In the third episode of the season, we found out:</p><ul style=text-align:start><li style=text-align:left>Terrier Mask (Duff Goldman from Season 7)</li><li style=text-align:left>“Sometimes you have to build a bridge to get over it.

But to the world, I go by something completely different.” This clue was partnered with a few others on April 26:</p><ul><li>Vinyl Record</li><li>May have been on a competition show</li><li>The Sun</li></ul><p>For Medusa’s performance, they gave us a rendition of “Mercy” by Shawn Mendes.</p><p>On May 3, Medusa gave us this clue: "Mom."</p><p>“Being an artist is my greatest passion, but being a mom is my favorite job.” So, it looks like we should start scanning Hollywood for stars who are mothers.</p><p>“I have experienced devastating loss in my life,” Medusa added. They performed “Someone Like You” by Adele who is also a mother!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Fans loved Medusa’s performance of “Take Me to Church” by Hozier on May 10.

Medusa's identity will be spoiled below.</strong></p><p>After Medusa performed "New York, New York" by Frank Sinatra the judges made their guesses.</p><p>Nicole guessed that Medusa might be Florence Welch or <a href=#>Lorde</a>. Robin thought Medusa could be <a href=#>Apple Martin</a>. Ken's wild guess was Susan Boyle.</p><p>On April 26, each of the judges cast their vote again. Nicole doubled down on her Lorde guess and Robin thought Medusa was Ke$ha. However, Ken decided to stick with his guess of Scottish singer Susan Boyle.</p><p>By May 3, everyone's guesses shifted a bit. Robin's thought was that Medusa could be British singer <a href=#>Ellie Goulding</a>. Nicole switched her vote over to Imogen Heap. Plus, Jenny guessed Ashlee Simpson.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>With the connection to herself in mind, on May 10, Robin guessed Grimes. Plus, Nicole guessed Lorde and Ken guessed Dido. Even the judges are having a tough time.</p><p>The final guesses were probably the best so far. Robin doubled down on her Grimes guess. Jenny thought Medusa was Fergie. Finally, Nicole said Bishop Briggs.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, who is Medusa on 'The Masked Singer'? The answer is…</h2><p>Medusa is actually <a href=#>Bishop Briggs</a>, so Nicole was totally right. Bishop's real name is Sarah Grace McLaughlin and she's a well-known singer and songwriter in the alternative genre. Plus, Medusa actually ended up winning the whole season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKadlKrAonnToZxmpZGouKawjKygp5%2BVpw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./abbey-twentysomethings-ex-husband.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Abbey of 'Twentysomethings' Fame's Ex-Husband?</span></a>
