Now put some respect on my name little girl. I walked so you could ‘dance.’”</p><p>Like van der Pol, Siwa is also a former child star. She got her start on the Lifetime reality series Dance Moms in 2015 before signing a contract with Nickelodeon in 2017 and acting in various shows and films for the network. She also released several children’s songs and her own feature film, The J Team, under Nickelodeon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/02-Thats-So-Raven-Anneliese-van-der-Pol-Hits-Back-After-JoJo-Siwa-TikTok-Comment.jpg><p>Siwa wasn’t the only person taken aback by van der Pol, who played Raven Baxter’s (<strong>Raven-Symoné</strong>) best friend Chelsea on That’s So Raven and Raven’s Home, celebrating the spinoff’s demise.</p><p>After one TikTok user questioned whether van der Pol had “a falling out” or “bad blood” with Raven, 38, van der Pol replied with a <a href=# rel=noopener>cryptic video</a>.</p><p>In the clip, van der Pol lip synced to the viral TikTok sound, “We’re about to find out, honey. We just got started so I’ll let you know.”</p><p>The actress previously suggested that she was fired from Raven’s Home in an August 2023 <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok video</a> by using a sound from the Disney Channel show Phineas and Ferb.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/01-Thats-So-Raven-Anneliese-van-der-Pol-Hits-Back-After-JoJo-Siwa-TikTok-Comment.jpg><p>“Wow! If I had a nickel for every time I was asked to leave a show starring Raven …,” she wrote alongside the clip before lip syncing along with the audio, saying, “I’d have two nickels, which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice, right?”</p><p>Van der Pol hashtagged both That’s So Raven and Raven’s Home in the caption. She starred on all 4 seasons of the OG series, which aired from 2003 to 2007, before returning for the spinoff in 2017. She appeared in the first four seasons of Raven’s Home and was a guest star in season 5, but did not return for the final season, which came to an end in 2023.</p><p>As for her recent beef with Siwa, van der Pol was unaware of the “Karma” singer’s shady comment until her fellow Disney Channel alum <strong>Christy Carlson Romano</strong> pointed it out to her.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Didn’t JoJo Siwa actually go into your comment section?” Carlson Romano, 40, said during the Thursday, June 6, episode of her and van der Pol’s “Big Name Bitches” podcast.</p><p>Van der Pol replied that she’d seen people talking about someone named JoJo in her comments, but didn’t know what they were referring to.</p><p>“This is how old and stupid I am. … I was like, ‘What’s JoJo?’ I truly was like, ‘JoJo Rabbit?’” she said, referring to the 2019 film written and directed by<strong> Taika Waititi</strong>. “I have no idea what people are talking about.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoJGpwG6%2Fzmapmq6Vo8Burc2nnKWhlaiybsLAp2SdnaJivbC4jKKqZp6VqrGqusZmrqKsmGK3sLbOZqqir5Fk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-caussin-net-worth-203128.html><span>←</span><span>Michael Caussin Net Worth</span></a>
