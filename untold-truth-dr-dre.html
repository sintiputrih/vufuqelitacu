Later in 1993, Eazy-E responded with his own diss track called "Real Muthaph****in G's." <a href=#>Representative lyrics</a>, which are clearly about Dre, include lines like, "Hey yo, Doctor, here's another proper track / and it's phat, watch the sniper, time to pay the piper." So ... they basically threatened to murder each other in song.</p><p>But why such acrimony in the first place? Money. The gangsta rap collective N.W.A. came apart in 1990 after only a few years of togetherness, when Ice Cube left because he felt he wasn't being properly paid (via <a href=#>The Hip Hop Foundation</a>). Dr. Dre also had concerns that Ruthless Records boss Jerry Heller was cheating the band, and told Eazy-E to either get rid of Heller or lose a band mate and a friend. Eazy-E chose Heller. (Around the same time, a record company bodyguard named Suge Knight was considering starting his own record label — that became Death Row Records, the new home for Dr. Dre.) The feud was only resolved with the death of Eazy-E from complications of AIDS in 1995, and the acrimonious N.W.A. split was permanent. The only member of N.W.A. to attend Eazy-E's funeral was DJ&nbsp;Yella, reports <a href=#>LA Weekly</a>. In 2015, Dre's stance had softened considerably, saying that if Eazy-E were alive today, "we would probably be working together right now, and arguing about the work," reports <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2FkXFtamelo8GwuMNmq6utpJ16pb6MnameZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anna-faris.html><span>←</span><span>The Symbolism Behind Wooden Maps: More Than Just Geography</span></a>
