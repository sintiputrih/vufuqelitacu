Miss CEO is known for snapping photos in her impeccable outfits with that quintessential cool girl stare — you know, it’s an LA thing — but Kylie dropped influencer etiquette while being photographed at her NYE festivities. While rocking a glittery, silver sequined dress, Kylie pulled a face that could only be described as Cher Horowitz’s “As if!” expression. In the next photo, she grabbed her breasts and appeared to yell at the camera — the most relatable pose, really. Kylie had an explanation for her care-free poses, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pictures which you can see here</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“When the tequila hits u 😂🎉🎈🥂,” Kylie captioned the Instagram photos, which she shared on Jan. 2. Isn’t that an all too familiar feeling! Seated by Kylie’s side was her good friend <strong>Yris Palmer</strong>, 29. Kylie didn’t drop a location tag, but she was reported to have spent the night at Delilah night club in West Hollywood, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>. However, paparazzi also photographed the businesswoman at <strong>The Weekdnd’s</strong> NYE bash at his Beverly Hills home that night — the same function that her ex, <strong>Travis Scott</strong>, 27, attended! It’s unclear if they crossed paths.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Ahead of 2020, Kylie shared her advice to fans who weren’t entirely satisfied with their 2019. “Happy New Years Eve 🖤.. when you start to feel like things should have been better this year remember all the mountains and valleys that got you HERE.. 🖤 there is more to you than yesterday. 2020 positive vibes ONLY xx,” the billionaire wrote underneath a portrait of herself on Instagram. Mentions of “mountains and valleys” brings to mind Kylie’s own struggles in 2019, which sadly included <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a fallout</a> with her longtime best friend, <strong>Jordyn Woods</strong>, 22, and her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reported breakup</a> with Travis.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Kylie’s New Year’s resolutions do not include getting back together with Travis, despite their amicable relationship.&nbsp;“Right now Kylie is focusing on herself and her daughter [<strong>Stormi Webster</strong>] and co-parenting and those are really her only concerns,” a source close to the family EXCLUSIVELY told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>. “She’s told some friends she doesn’t think she will be working things out with Travis in a romantic way in 2020 or beyond.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH1ye49sZqSxnJ6ybrbEp6Weql2cuarA056psmWjmr62tc2em2almaO2brDRnqqsZZKkvLW%2FjKecsGWpmq6zv4yerZ5loJ28tbvSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katey-sagal-married-with-children-was-misogynistic-w475137.html><span>←</span><span>Katey Sagal: 'Married With Children' Was 'Misogynistic'</span></a>
