Excerpts from the book have already gone public, including the 56-year-old’s recollections about her relationship with Kutcher, which lasted from 2003 to 2011.</p><p>“<a href=#>[I was enjoying] a do-over</a>, like I could just go back in time and experience what it was like to be young, with him — much more so than I’d ever been able to experience it when I was actually in my twenties,” she wrote in the book, according to <a href=#>The New York Times</a>.</p><p>The G.I. Jane star wrote that she and Kutcher were once expecting a baby girl she planned to name Chaplin Ray but <a href=#>lost the child to a miscarriage</a>.</p><p>She also said that she and Kutcher <a href=#>had threesomes during their marriage</a>, at his urging. “I wanted to show him how great and fun I could be,” she wrote, per <a href=#>Radar Online</a>.</p><p>Then Moore saw reports about Kutcher cheating on her with pilates instructor <strong>Sara Leal</strong>, who <a href=#>revealed the affair</a> in an exclusive interview with Us Weekly in 2011. “I felt sick to my stomach,” Moore explained. “I knew she wasn’t lying.”</p><p>According to the excerpt, Kutcher tried to “deflect blame” and cited the threesomes when the Disclosure actress confronted him about the infidelity rumors. “Because we had brought a third party into our relationship, Ashton said, that blurred the lines and, to some extent, justified what he’d done,” Moore wrote.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Ghost star was previously married to <a href=#><strong>Bruce Willis</strong></a> from 1987 to 2000, and she shares three daughters with the Glass actor: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Rumer</strong></a>, 31, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Scout</strong></a>, 28, and <strong>Tallulah</strong>, 25.</p><p>Kutcher began dating Kunis in 2012, and the former That ‘70s Show costars tied the knot in 2015.
