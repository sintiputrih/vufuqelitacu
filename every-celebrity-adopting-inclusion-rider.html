"I just found out about this last week," she said in the press room following the ceremony. "[This] has always been available to all—everybody that does a negotiation on a film, an inclusion rider—which means that you can ask for and/or demand at least 50 percent diversity in not only the casting but also the crew.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>ANGELA WEISS/AFP/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After hearing McDormand’s call to action, Mudbound director Dee Rees revealed that she’s been familiar with the inclusion rider for some time. "A lot of people of color have been doing that for a long time, unofficially, and demanding a certain number of people on set be people of color,” she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Buzzfeed</a>. “It's making your sets look like the world, at a minimum. And it's not just about tokenism, it's about talent. That's the exciting thing. People with the ability and the ambition can have opportunities that are commensurate with who they are."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Selma director Ava DuVernay has also spoken up about the use of inclusion riders. While she’s previously shared her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>appreciation</a> for the contractual clause ("I'm really supportive of any idea that looks at ways to get more kinds of people, and more cultures, more races, more diversity and gender behind the camera."), she didn’t personally use one on her latest film, A Wrinkle in Time. When asked on Twitter whether she'd used one, DuVernay answered, “Nope. Just hired people of all kinds and colors,” prompting social media users to sing her praises.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since McDormand delivered her impassioned speech on March 4, many members of the entertainment industry have vowed to adopt inclusion riders in all projects going forward.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Scroll down below to see which directors, actors, and producers have followed McDormand’s lead so far.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-michael-b-jordan></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Michael B.
