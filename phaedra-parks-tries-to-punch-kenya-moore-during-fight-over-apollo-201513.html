Although <strong>Apollo Nida</strong> turned himself in to begin his eight-year prison sentence, the jailbird left many messes behind that he can’t fix. Wife and new single mom <strong>Phaedra Parks</strong> reignites a feud with longtime frenemy <strong>Kenya Moore</strong> — after the beauty queen finds out about Phaedra’s alleged affair.</p><p><strong>Kenya Cries</strong></p><p>Over a wine-tasting, the girls spill more tea than vino. Blabbermouth <strong>Cynthia Bailey</strong> tells allies Kenya and <strong>Claudia Jordan</strong> about Apollo’s allegations that Phaedra took on a lover, an African prince named Chocolate.</p><p>Cynthia quotes the texts that husband <strong>Peter Thomas</strong> told her about. “‘I can’t wait to get off the plantation.’ She’s in love with this guy!”</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async width=476 height=449 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Kenya Moore" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“Phaedra has had issues telling the truth,” Cynthia recalls in her confessional, citing the lawyer’s spottiness about the due date of her second baby, and the time where she denied dissing Cynthia over a party invitation (though the proof was in the voicemail!). “After all these years, I can’t say that I know Phaedra that well — but I do know her representative.”</p><p>Cynthia claims that the reason why she shared this information with the girls is because of the hypocrisy in the group. Phaedra called Kenya a whore after Apollo lied about their flirty exchange in Las Vegas. And in Puerto Rico, <strong><a href=#>NeNe Leakes</a></strong> infamously told Claudia that her “clit has left her body.”&nbsp;</p><p>Kenya begins to sob as she remembers the pain caused by Phaedra and Apollo’s allegations.</p><p>“You’re sitting here…making people think I’ve done these foul things,” she says through her tears. “You’re the main one. You don’t get to call me a whore!”</p><p><img decoding=async width=476 height=432 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Cynthia Bailey" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The girls comfort her, and Claudia declares that after all of this, Kenya should feel vindicated. Kenya agrees.</p><p>“My karma is very strong,” Kenya says. “Because all of my enemies fall!”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Phaedra Gets Rid of Her Demons</strong></p><p>Phaedra hadn’t been spending much time at home — she sought refuge at a hotel as Apollo enjoyed his last few moments of freedom.</p><p>In an effort to start fresh, she asks Apostle Thaddeus and his wife, Chandra, to bless her home. They pray over the entire house, including Dylan’s room — where Apollo punched a hole through the wall — and the garage, where he terrorized Phaedra with a drill in his hand.</p><p>“I know by the time that they are done, all evilness will be totally eradicated,” Phaedra says in her confessional.</p><p><img decoding=async width=476 height=641 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt=Phaedra style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Later on that week, Kandi visits Phaedra’s demon-free home for some lemonade — and, of course, the tea on what went down with Apollo. Though Phaedra acted happy to see Kandi, she couldn’t help but note her bosom-buddy’s absence over the last few weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>“I haven’t really talked to Phaedra that much,” Kandi admits in her confessional. “I’m having drama with my marriage…and when things ain’t going right with my money, I’m not really thinking about what anyone else is going through.”</p><p>Phaedra tells Kandi about the horrendous days that led up to Apollo’s exit.</p><p>“He told me he’d burn down the house,” Phaedra recalls. “He had punched holes in the walls…I let him see the kids. For 15 minutes, he talked to Ayden. For two hours, he screamed bloody murder and went crazy on me.”</p><p>Though Apollo’s last days were a nightmare for Phaedra, she tells Kandi that she feels relieved — and that for the first time, she can “take care of the kids and do me.” Phaedra reveals, to Kandi’s surprise, that Nene has been particularly supportive throughout the whole ordeal, and has called her every day.</p><p>“I’m not sure why Kandi’s taken aback,” Phaedra says in her confessional. “NeNe has been a rock and she hasn’t.”</p><p><strong>Kenya Confronts Phaedra</strong></p><p>Kandi invites all of the girls to dinner, where drama breaks out before dessert.</p><p>Cynthia tells Phaedra that Peter and Apollo talked before Apollo turned himself in. It was obvious that Phaedra didn’t want to hear it, but Cynthia continues anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>“Peter told me that he found out you were dating some guy,” Cynthia says. “Apollo actually showed Peter the text messages.”</p><p>“Don’t tell me what my husband said,” Phaedra counters. “Worry about your own. If you didn’t see it for yourself, you can’t believe it.”</p><p>Kenya chimes in…and goes for the jugular. She calls Phaedra out for her feigned cluelessness and reminds Phaedra about “the text messages that Peter saw, that you sent to Mr. Chocolate…the man that you’ve been going around, having an affair with!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Phaedra swings at Kenya with her clutch as the beauty queen spews her venom. <strong>Porsha Williams</strong> steps in, and drags Phaedra, who threatens to “whip her ass,” out of the restaurant.</p><p>“You don’t want to know the truth! You go around calling everyone a whore, and you’re the biggest whore here,” Kenya says to Phaedra as she’s carried out.</p><p>“These hens can cluck all they want,” Phaedra says in her confessional. “I’m not afraid to take them to the slaughterhouse and chop their heads off if I need to.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapoJGasbOtjKmYq6OjYsGztcSsZK2nXaXCr6%2FHZqKepqmWeq67zqucZpylp7avs4yfoKCgpGK8t7HRZpipp5yhvG5%2Bj2psamtf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mike-fisher.html><span>←</span><span>Mike Fisher Net Worth Salary and Earnings From Ice Hockey</span></a>
