In the beginning, eight main characters were introduced, including Dr. Michael and Jane Mancini, Billy Campbell, Alison Parker, Jake Hanson, Matt Fielding, Rhonda Blair and Sandy Harling. Throughout the years, many new personalities were added to the mix, and a lot of them were former and would-be future soap stars — like <i>The Bold and the Beautiful</i> and <i>General Hospital</i> fave Jack Wagner (Nick; Frisco) as Dr. Peter Burns.</p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Meet the Blue Bloods stars’ real-life partners</a></p><p>However, one of the first names to come to mind when thinking back on the primetime soap will always be Heather Locklear, who ended up boosting the show’s ratings. Though tough-as-nails Amanda Woodward didn’t storm onto the scene until later in the first season, the character was a force to be reckoned with and had been involved with just about every male on the show.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/melrose-place-PARAMOUNT.jpg alt=melrose width=300 height=397 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Locklear went on to reprise her role in the 2009 reboot, as did a few others including Calabro, Bissett, Laura Leighton, and Daphne Zuniga. In the end, low ratings and negative reviews led to its cancellation after just one season. You know what they say… the originals are always the best and in this case, it proved to be correct.</p><p><b>Take a walk down memory lane by viewing our gallery below featuring <a href=# rel=noopener>30 then-and-now photos of the <i>Melrose Place</i> stars</a>, as well as fun facts surrounding their characters and personal lives, then leave us your favorite memories from the series in the comment section.</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhuZmWEdoWOppylqp%2Bosm68y5qanmWTlsC1edOhnKdlkaOxbrrOsGSpoJ%2BpvLR50q2Yq6tdm7y5edKomKlln6Wys62O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heres-what-jenny-mccarthy-looks-like-without-makeup.html><span>←</span><span>Here's What Jenny McCarthy Looks Like Without Makeup</span></a>
