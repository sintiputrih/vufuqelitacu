Not that we’re complaining, mind you, as it still presented us with an excellent season of television, full of compelling characters and tantalizing plot twists. But for its sophomore outing, you can expect things to be a bit lighter."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Everything was geared toward telling that story. And how do we reach our ideals, sometimes you have to go through darkness to come out and realize what you really hold up to be true. So, yes it was unfamiliar in some ways, but it was still ultimately steeped in the tenets and beliefs in this universe, always. Going to humanity’s higher purpose. But, yes, it was unusually dark.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/star-trek-discovery-premiere-004-1022780.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/star-trek-discovery-premiere-005-1022781.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/star-trek-discovery-premiere-006-1022782.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/star-trek-discovery-premiere-001-1022783.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/star-trek-discovery-premiere-002-1022784.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/star-trek-discovery-premiere-003-1022785.jpg><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>Given <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anson Mount’s introduction as Captain Pike in season 2</a>, things will lighten up considerably, with Rapp explaining that he sets a very different tone.</p><p>So in [season two] we have moved through this and come out the other side. Pike is sort of an exemplary captain. He is exactly the kind of familiar Starfleet captain you would always want. And I think that alone sets such a different tone. And yes, there is certainly more humor, but there is also this settling that happens after all the craziness of season one and all the massive events. Now, in season two, so much of it gets to settle and we get to deal with it. And there is time and space for all of that, which is really satisfying.</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=209 data-injectable=false>The second installment of CBS’&nbsp;<strong>Star Trek: Discovery</strong>&nbsp;series is expected to drop early next year, when&nbsp;Ethan Peck will be joining&nbsp;Sonequa Martin-Green and Co. on the flight deck <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">as the legendary Spock</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yiutOhpqexXaeusbyMrJiyq12owaK%2BjK2pnqNdmba0r86vnKuxXaiyor%2FOp2RrZZmoeq7BwqFkpaGXncGmvoyipWasn6OycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./myrna-pride.html><span>←</span><span>Myrna Pride Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Married, Facts</span></a>
