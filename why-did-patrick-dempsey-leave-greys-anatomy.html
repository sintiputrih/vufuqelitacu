The network and studio came down and we had sessions with them. I think he was just done with the show. He didn’t like the inconvenience of coming in every day and working.

But you have to be grateful, because you’re well compensated, so you can’t really complain because you don’t really have a right… It [was] hard to say no to that kind of money.
