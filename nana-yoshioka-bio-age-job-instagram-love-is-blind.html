But because he is no player and was instead looking to find ‚Äúthe one‚Äù the right way, even all these women seemed quite aware of him not being the casanova-type.</p><p>Eventually, it was Nana who ultimately won over the hairstylist. And over a short period, viewers saw them cover their drive, professions, pet peeves, opinions on tattoos, and much more within that short period.</p><p>Nana admitted that Yudai had been giving her butterflies from the very first time she saw him. Yudai, blessed with the confession, also acknowledged that she was the one always on his mind and not the other women.</p><p>Soon, we also saw Yudai get down on one knee asking Nana to be with him. The proposal went something like this: ‚ÄúHow do I say it? When we talk, you‚Äôre the one I have the most values in common with.‚Äù And when he finally popped the question, Nana who was originally freaking out said ‚ÄòYes‚Äô, and gladly.</p><p>Joining Nana on this dating journey, other than Yudai, Ayano and Eri, were twelve more men: Takumi, Jinya, Mori, Shuntaro, Odacchi, Atsushi, Sho, Misaki, Ryotaro, Ryoga, Mizuki, Wataru, and 8 more women: Toshie, Midori, Motomi, Minami, Maki, Priya, Kaoru, and Nanako.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Are Nana Yoshioka And Yudai Honma Still Together?</strong></h3><p>Nana Yoshioka turned out to be following Yudai Honma on Instagram and he too did the same (as of the time of this writing).
