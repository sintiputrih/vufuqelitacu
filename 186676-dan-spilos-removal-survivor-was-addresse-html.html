Jeff admitted that Kellee's concerns were legitimate, that she was right for speaking up as he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/how-survivor-finale-addressed-dan-spilo-behavior/>added</a>:</p><p class=dh>“You were right to speak up, you were right to step forward despite a lot of risk, to speak your truth and I want to acknowledge and apologize for your pain.

After the episode aired, Dan received his ban from appearing on the reunion special by the CBS legal department.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Dan Spilo</a> planned on apologizing for his actions after receiving the boot on the reunion show, but since he could no longer attend, he issued a statement through PEOPLE.</p><p class=dh>He wanted people to know that he always tried to interact with others decently.
