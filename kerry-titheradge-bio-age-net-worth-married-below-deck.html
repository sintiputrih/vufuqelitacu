He is prepared to sail the Nordic seas coming with 30 years of experience working on boats and has spent almost two decades yachting.</p><p>Captain Kerry is a disciplined and fair leader. B<span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>ut that does not mean he will give his crew a hard time. The yachting vet prefers a laid-back approach to the team as he is just as relaxed in real life.</span></p><p>This season his leadership is also put to the test when a crew member becomes insubordinate early on and he must relearn to trust his team.</p><p>Said journey of Below Deck this time takes place in the fjords of Norway. And the ship’s captain said about this, that he does not want the viewers to just see the breathtaking destination but also wants them to feel the adrenaline of the scenery. Kerry himself loved the place so much, its people, how they acted there. About Norway, he also loved its cleanliness, its so many electric cars, and almost everything.</p><p>Kerry also found&nbsp;the guests partaking in the wild activities to be equally entertaining. Comparing them to those appearing on other iterations of Below Deck, he said his guests are so different. (Of course), in the beginning, he had concerns as to what kind of guests he is going to get.</p><p>In his recent interviews, Kerry also previewed adrenaline-pumping excursions, including a scary incident involving one charter guest. He told E! News that one guest nearly got seriously hurt. He also teased how all of the guests wanted to do something adventurous and to be out of their comfort level.</p><p>Below Deck guests&nbsp;have been known to do their fair share of alcohol-fueled partying, and this season too promises to be no different; one&nbsp;of the rowdiest groups it saw was one celebrating a guest’s recent divorce.</p><p>Not to miss, the captain has also admitted to touching his yacht against something.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Kerry Titheradge Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Kerry Titheradge reportedly made an estimated $100,000 per year salary.
