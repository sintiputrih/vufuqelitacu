My bleeding was the result of a clot. I was put on bed rest until it was gone. The next appointment, there was growth — not much, but some. After a few weeks, my doctors concluded that this was a placenta problem, not a kid problem. Although we never want any problem, this was a relief.”</p><p>The then-expectant star added at the time: “I am going to appointments two days a week. They continue to monitor her heartbeat and her growth. When they notice her growth start to slow is when they will make the call to take her out. This could be anywhere from 35 to 37 weeks. In one to three weeks, I could be delivering my angel and all I keep praying for is she comes out healthy. That is all I think about every day, all day.”</p><p>When her baby girl arrived, the Give Them Lala Beauty creator<a href=#> received supportive comments</a> from her costars, from <a href=#><strong>Brittany Cartwright</strong></a> to<a href=#> <strong>Kristen Doute</strong></a>.</p><p>“Congratulations gorgeous! You did amazing and I can’t wait to meet beautiful baby Ocean!! I love you guys so so much!! So proud of you,” the Kentucky native wrote, while the He’s Making You Crazy author commented, “I love you my gorgeous La and you little baby Ocean! I can’t believe she’s here!”</p><p>Prior to becoming a parent, Kent was a loving stepparent. <a href=#>Emmett gushed exclusively to Us Weekly </a>in May 2020 about her bond with London and Rylee.</p><p>“At her age, she just stepped up,” the Emmett/Furla/Oasis Films cocreator explained at the time. “And [Lala] has really been there for me as a partner, but also as a stepmom. I’m just very blessed that the girls just love her the way they do and she loves them the way they do and they have this bond.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Less than one year after welcoming Ocean, Emmett and Kent split.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see the former couple’s daughter, from hospital photos to sleepy selfies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkuaK4wGainqakYr%2BiusOao6VllaK6psDTrGSdmaWctbWx0WamnJ2Ro8BurcubrKZlkpavunnPopqsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-hes-always-been-faithful-conversations-version-by-sara-groves.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning Behind The Song: Hes Always Been Faithful (Conversations Version) by Sara Groves</span></a>
