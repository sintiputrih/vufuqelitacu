Methrone Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴&nbsp;&nbsp;Line by Line Meaning ↴Wassup Baby
I've been waiting on this moment for such a long time
Me and you, one on one
Listen. Me and you
Chillin' in my bedroom baby All alone So we can get real freaky baby I touch your body
To let you know that the time is now I would want
To love you like you never been loved baby So make it silk rain on meIt will be me and you together Rollin' in the bed"><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The lyrics are straightforward and convey a sense of anticipation and excitement at the prospect of spending some alone time with his significant other. He mentions that he has been waiting for this moment for a long time and emphasizes the idea that they will be alone and can be "real freaky." This sentiment continues throughout the song, with the singer expressing his love for his partner and describing how he wants to make her feel. The chorus repeats again and again that they will be "loving each other for life."</p><br><p>The tone of the song is very intimate, and the lyrics are intended to be suggestive. The singer describes how he wants to touch his partner's body and how much he loves being close to her. He encourages her to be confident and to be herself, saying that he will love her no matter what. Throughout the song, the singer emphasizes the idea that they are alone together and that no one else matters.</p><br><p>Overall, "Lovin' Each Other 4 Life" is a sensual and romantic song that expresses the deep connection between two people who have a strong physical and emotional bond.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Wassup Baby</u><br>Greeting, How are you doing?</p><br><p><u>I've been waiting on this moment for such a long time</u><br>I've been eagerly waiting for this moment for quite some time now.</p><br><p><u>Me and you, one on one</u><br>It's just going to be you and me, alone together.</p><br><p><u>Chillin' in my bedroom baby</u><br>Let's relax and spend time in my bedroom.</p><br><p><u>All alone</u><br>With nobody else around.</p><br><p><u>So we can get real freaky baby</u><br>Let's get really intimate with each other.</p><br><p><u>I touch your body</u><br>To show you that I want to be intimate with you.</p><br><p><u>To let you know that the time is now</u><br>To convey the sense of urgency I feel to be with you now.</p><br><p><u>I would want to love you like you never been loved baby</u><br>I desire to make love to you in such a way that you've never experienced before.</p><br><p><u>So make it silk rain on me</u><br>Let your love and affection pour over me like a smooth and silky rain.</p><br><p><u>It will be me and you together</u><br>We will be together.</p><br><p><u>Rollin' in the bed</u><br>Simply enjoying each other's company in bed.</p><br><p><u>Hiding in the covers</u><br>Enjoying each other's company while under the covers.</p><br><p><u>Loving each other for life babe</u><br>Our love will last forever, baby.</p><br><p><u>Loving you</u><br>My love for you runs deep.</p><br><p><u>Is constantly up on my mind</u><br>I always think about you and our love.</p><br><p><u>Toe to toe</u><br>Body-to-body, skin-to-skin, close and intimate with each other.</p><br><p><u>With your body on top of mine</u><br>Your body pressing against mine.</p><br><p><u>Soaking wet</u><br>Drenched in passion and desire.</p><br><p><u>That's the way I like it baby</u><br>This is how I enjoy making love with you, baby.</p><br><p><u>So don't forget the towels</u><br>We need towels to mop up all this passion!</p><br><p><u>As you step into my room</u><br>As you enter my room, ready to be intimate with me.</p><br><p><u>Break it down</u><br>Let's get down to it...</p><br><p><u>Said I like it baby</u><br>I really like the way we're getting along.</p><br><p><u>That's the way its gonna be</u><br>This is the way it's supposed to be between us.</p><br><p><u>Me and you one on one</u><br>Just you and me, fully engaged with each other.</p><br><p><u>In my bedroom</u><br>We're going to fully explore our love and passion in my bedroom.</p><br><p><u>I say your gonna like it darlin'</u><br>I think you're really going to enjoy this, my love.</p><br><p><u>Oh wee..</u><br>Expressing pleasure and excitement.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © O/B/O APRA AMCOS</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maIWVqbWzu82eZoWnpp67qKukmpqhl5%2Bptaa%2Bvp%2Bmq5ecnrOm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jamie-siminoff-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jamie Siminoff Net Worth: A Look at the Entrepreneurs Impressive Career and Wealth</span></a>
