The 'Collateral' star, 55, developed a clot in the brain which led to the mysterious medical emergency after he was pressured to take a Covid vaccine.</p><p>In an appearance on the 'Ask Dr Drew' podcast, veteran journalist A J Benza, a former New York Daily writer and the host of the E! series 'Mysteries and Scandals,' made the claim citing reliable sources. According to Benza, a source who was in Foxx's room and was involved in his care told him that the "blood clot in his brain caused him at that point to be partially paralyzed and blind," <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Radar Online</a>&nbsp;reported.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Foxx suffered a medical complication while filming 'Back in Action'&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/47ef3dd5-e96e-4999-80ac-3ee4841611a0.1415909007><p>The 'Django Unchained' star reportedly suffered a 'medical complication' on the set in Atlanta on April 11 while filming 'Back in Action' with his co-star Cameron Diaz which also happens to mark her return to acting. As the star remained hospitalized with no clarity on the nature of the medical condition, the film continued to shoot with a Foxx's body double.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>'We need you back bro'</h2><p>The publication previously reported that Foxx's loved ones had been "preparing for the worst" as he remained in the hospital. Jamie’s people are saying he’s doing OK and improving while the doctors are trying to get to the bottom of his problems — but he wouldn’t be in a hospital this long if he was anything close to OK,” said a source. Prior to that, his friend Charles E Alston, known as Charlie Mack, requested his fans to pray for Foxx. "We need you back bro. As I always state a true champion isn’t the one that wins, it’s the one that meets & overcomes adversity!!," he wrote on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>'In fact, he was playing pickleball yesterday!'</h2><p>However, Jamie Foxx's daughter Corinne Foxx called the story far from fact, stating that her father was recuperating and that the duo even played pickleball. “Sad to see how the media runs wild. My dad has been out of the hospital for weeks, recuperating. In fact, he was playing pickleball yesterday!” she added. “Thanks for everyone’s prayers and support! We have an exciting work announcement coming next week too!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/f73fc0d1-ea6e-4d91-a978-d9c0def14caf.1167906110><h2 class=split>'Is that why he fired three or four people?'</h2><p>Benza rubbished the claims in the podcast stating the family's statement was "all lies" and "baloney." “I am thinking, ‘Is that why he blew up on the set a week before this medical emergency happened?’ Benza questioned Dr Drew Pinsky on the podcast. “Is that why he fired three or four people because he had had it with these mandates?" he asked further. “If you read into what they were saying early on, ‘He is communicating with us.’ That doesn’t mean talking. That could be anything. Writing. Sign language. I know those little code words. Then you tell me your father is playing pickleball, give me a break. There is a great shroud of secrecy around Jamie Foxx.”</p><h2 class=split>'It is not a stroke'</h2><p>Dr Drew, who is a practicing physician said, “Blood in the brain is a cerebral bleed. It is not a stroke. A stroke is a blood clot in an artery to the brain that cuts off the blood supply to the brain and the brain dies. It has been widely known that he had a stroke, right? They have said stroke many times. To say it is a blood clot in the brain, it is a stroke. It is a blood clot in an artery that cuts off the supply … that part of the brain is dead. It has very serious consequences. It depends on which artery and what the anatomy of that artery is to what parts of the brain and what not.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoopGitqZ5xaivsWWcmrO1ec%2Baqa2hkaG5unnBpaCnnF2Wu6V5z5qpmqSpr7KlecOunGasn2KvrbvOnWScpJ%2Bpeqq6jJupmqGeYq6nwMSrZJynpp6xbsLAnJqippVit7DB0aeYpaGjqXqkuMCipKw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-old-is-shane-pittman-from-28-days-haunted-wikipedia-age-and-family-ethnicity.html><span>←</span><span>How Old Is Shane Pittman From 28 Days Haunted?
