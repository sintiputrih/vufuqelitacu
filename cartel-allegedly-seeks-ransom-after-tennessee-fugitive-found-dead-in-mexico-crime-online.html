Ridenour was captured the following day, but Kennedy remained on the run and was placed on the state’s most wanted list.</p><p>By November, Stockton told the Roane County News that he believed Kennedy had gone to Mexico.</p><p>“When you go to Mexico, all bets are off,” Stockton said. “He may never show up again in the United States.”</p><p>Days after Stockton made those remarks, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation got a tip from Mexican authorities that Kennedy had been found dead in Iguala, Guerrero state. The agency got confirmation of his identity last week, WBIR reported.</p><p>After the confirmation, Kennedy’s sister contacted Roane County authorities to say she’d been contacted by an alleged cartel member seeking a ransom for his body, WVLT reported.</p><p>“We believe it was the cartel,” Stockton said. “They sent a video showing that he was deceased and they wanted money to get his body back.”</p><p>Stockton said he advised the sister not to pay and added that authorities were already working to return the body.</p><p>At the time of his escape, Kennedy faced charges of evading arrest, theft, unlawful possession of a weapon, possession of a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony, vandalism, and methamphetamine – manufacture, delivery, sell or possess in Fentress County and burglary of a motor vehicle, theft, altering an item’s permanent distinguishing numbers, and tampering with or fabricating evidence in Roane County.</p><p><strong>For the latest true crime and justice news,&nbsp;subscribe to the ‘Crime Stories with Nancy Grace’ podcast</strong></p><p>[Featured image: Charles Kennedy/Tennessee Bureau of Investigation]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX5ius8DEpWSapJyatKawy7JkrJ2VoMBuvsCnqqilXZaztbHRZquepp6awLSxxGadrp%2BZqba3sYyfpq6mlGKxpq3DZqCnZZ2axaqvzmaaq6GdmnqwusuipZ5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tristan-thompson-slams-dad-abandoning-younger-brother-though-he-did-that-to-his-son.html><span>←</span><span>Tristan Thompson Slams His Dad For Abandoning Younger Brother Even Though He Did That To His Son</span></a>
