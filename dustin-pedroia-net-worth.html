Pedroia is a two-time World Series champion (2007 and 2013), has been selected to four All-Star games (2008-2010, and 2013), won four Gold Glove Awards (2008, 2011, 2013, and 2014), a Silver Slugger Award (2008), and was the American League’s MVP in 2008. His career started in 2006.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Dustin Pedroia is, as of early 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Pedroia’s net worth is as high as $20 million, an amount earned largely through his pro baseball career. In addition to playing baseball, Pedroia also has sponsorship deals, and with an annual salary of $12 million continues to improved his wealth.</p><h3>Dustin Pedroia Net Worth $20 Million</h3><p>Dustin Pedroia grew up in California, where he went to Woodland High School and participated in both baseball and football programs, as well as playingd tennis at Sacramento City College, but his hopes of becoming a pro football player were squashed after the future NFL linebacker <a href=#>Lance Briggs</a>’ tackle injured his ankle. Instead of football, he opted to continue playing baseball, and was the most valuable player in his senior year in high school.</p><p>He then enrolled at Arizona State University (ASU) and played for the Arizona State Sun Devils for three years, before being selected by the Boston Red Sox as the 65th pick overall in the MLB 2004 Draft. After spending two years in the minors, Pedroia debuted for the Red Sox in 2006 and became the regular second baseman in 2007. He ended the season with a championship title after the Red Sox defeated the Colorado Rockies in the 2007 World Series, and was voted the AL Rookie of the Year, plus being selected to the 2007 Topps Major League Rookie All-Star Team.</p><p>The next season was the best in Pedroia’s career, as he was rewarded with Silver Slugger and Gold Glove Awards, was selected to his first All-Star game, and was named the American League’s most valuable player (MVP). In December 2008, Dustin signed a fresh six-year contract with the Red Sox worth $40.5 million, with a team option for 2015 worth $11 million, which improved his net worth to a large degree. He made it to the All-Star team in 2009 and 2010, while in 2011 he won another Gold Glove Award. Pedroia became the ‘World Champion’ for the second time in his career after the Red Sox beat the St. Louis Cardinals in six matches. Dustin also appeared in his fourth and latest All-Star game, and also won his third Gold Glove Award – repeated in 2014, his most recent to date. The Red Sox were stopped in the first round of the playoffs in 2016, despite winning their division with a 93-69 record.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Dustin Pedroia has been married to Kelli since 2006, and has three sons with her. He is a big fan of the NBA’s Sacramento Kings, and the NFL’s San Francisco 49ers, and enjoys playing the card game cribbage.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=7.8642447418738><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Dustin Pedroia</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$20 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$12 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 17, 1983</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Woodland, California, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 9" (1.75 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>82 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Baseball player</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Arizona State University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Kelli Hatley</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Cole Pedroia, Dylan Pedroia</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Debbie Pedroia, Guy Pedroia</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Brett Pedroia</td></tr><tr readability=0.36842105263158><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/15lasershow</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2827474/</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>American League Most Valuable Player Award</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nominations</td><td>Best Major League Baseball Player ESPY Award</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=9.5><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Sunday Night Baseball</td><td>2006-2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Boston Red Sox Second Baseman / Himself - Boston Red Sox Shortstop / Second Baseman</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Mike & Mike</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Boston Red Sox Second Baseman</td></tr><tr><td>Rome Is Burning</td><td>2007-2009</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Late Show with David Letterman</td><td>2009</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Top Ten List Presenter</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>2008 MLB All-Star Game</td><td>2008</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Himself - AL Starting Second Baseman, Boston Red Sox</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>2007 World Series: Boston Red Sox vs. Colorado Rockies</td><td>2007</td><td>TV Mini-Series</td><td>Himself - Boston Red Sox Second Baseman</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>2007 American League Championship Series</td><td>2007</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - Boston Red Sox Second Baseman</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Archive Footage <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movie_no_img.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/2827474_Dustin-Pedroia/2827474_Rome-Is-Burning-20072009.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/2827474_Dustin-Pedroia/2827474_Late-Show-with-David-Letterman-2009.jpg><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjp2srKyZo3qxscOrpqKZXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alyx-weiss-cult.html><span>←</span><span>Did Social Media Influencer Alyx Weiss Join a Cult?</span></a>
