He was able to play with&nbsp;He had the opportunity to play with <a href=#>Carlos Santana</a>..</p><p>Michael “Mikey” Houser was born in Boone, North Carolina. He graduated from Hixson High School in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and became a founding member of Widespread Panic in 1986 while attending the University of Georgia with John Bell. Michael’s adolescent nickname was “Panic” due to his then frequent panic attacks, and this moniker later became the inspiration for the band’s name.</p><p>Houser played a discontinued Fender Telecaster Deluxe Plus. This guitar is a Telecaster body with Stratocaster hardware. Houser purchased his first Telecaster Deluxe Plus second hand in 1991. A guitar lasted him about five years, needing to be replaced “’cause [he] sweated into [them] so much”. Fender made two custom-remake replacements with his preferred discontinued Firestorm finish. Houser claimed of the three guitars, “they’re as close as modern science can get”</p><p align=justify>His wife and his two children survived him.</p><p align=justify>At forty years old, he died from cancer.</p><p align=justify>Michael Houser (January 6, 1962&nbsp;– August 10, 2002) was a founding member and lead guitarist of the band Widespread Panic. He appeared on seven studio albums during his 16-year tenure with the band from 1986 till 2002. He is also featured on 4 live albums by Widespread Panic (2 released posthumously), as well as several archive releases, live video concerts and compilations.</p><h2>Michael Houser Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Michael is one of the <strong>richest Guitarist</strong> from United States.

Houser didn’t like to use a whammy bar, preferring to pull up on the tail of the bridge instead. The mini switch is in between the volume and tone pots. This allows for a wider array of tones than a standard Telecaster. On most Telecasters, you can choose neck, bridge, or both pickups simultaneously. With the dual Reds in the bridge being splittable, you can choose neck, bridge dual, bridge single, or combinations of neck and dual bridge as well as neck and single bridge.</p><h2>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h2><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Michael Houser ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

His predominant use of the Ernie Ball volume pedal caused him to spend most of his performance time balanced on one leg, this would eventually lead to circulation problems causing his left leg to become numb. In 1996, during an acoustic tour known as the “Sit and Ski” tour, he was reminded of how much more comfortable and accurate his playing was while he was seated. Subsequently, Houser returned to playing all shows seated in 1997. His playing style used a volume pedal for sonic effect, rather than just for volume control.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Michael Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Guitarist</strong>.
