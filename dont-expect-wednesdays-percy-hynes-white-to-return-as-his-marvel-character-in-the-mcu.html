One thing we can likely be confident of, however, is that Marvel Studios won’t be inviting White to reprise his X-Men role in the MCU anytime soon, even though the universe continues to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">create stronger ties to Fox’s franchise</a> as the Multiverse Saga develops.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=479 data-current-count=779 data-injectable=true>Wednesday was not the first notable TV series based on a popular IP that White was involved in. From 2017-2019, he starred in a lead role in FOX’s The Gifted, set in the X-Men universe. For those who missed it, the series featured Stephen Moyer and Amy Acker as Reed and Caitlin Strucker, two parents who have to take their family on the run after their teen children are outed as mutants. Natalie Alyn Lind is older sister Lauren, while White played younger brother Andy.</p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true>The Strucker siblings were revealed to be the grandkids of X-Men villains Fenris, the twin children of Avengers: Age of Ultron villain Baron Von Strucker in the comics. That gives White something of a way-in to the MCU if Marvel ever wanted to fold The Gifted into its multiverse, but given <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the severe hit his reputation has taken of late</a>, it seems safe to assume we won’t be seeing him portray Andy Strucker again.</p><p data-characters=145 data-current-count=145 data-injectable=false>If Marvel wanted to bring back his co-stars <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Emma Dumont as Polaris and Jamie Chung as Blink</a> in the X-Men reboot, though, nobody would complain.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ylu82tZJ6woJqwtXnWnpunnaOZrrq%2FjKmcq5upYrW6usSsZLCgmamybsDOZqmerKWnu26t0mafoqtdoq6zwsSlZJygkaeupMDEq2Sipl2ptaZ5zJysaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./update-melvyn-foster-green-river-killer-victim-murder-and-death-wikipedia.html><span>←</span><span>Brittany Wilson Cape Girardeau Murder Victim: Who Is Stephen Foster Missouri?
