Leaving your dog chained up outside in the cold isn’t just inhumane, it’s now — at least in Pennsylvania — illegal.
Just before this winter set in, lawmakers in Pennsylvania decided that dog owners who leave their pets outside in sub-freezing temperatures for more than half an hour (or more than nine hours total in any 24-hour period) can face fines and perhaps even jail time, according to the York Daily Record."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Additionally, tethers must be sufficiently long and not likely to cause the dog to become entangled, while collars must be appropriately sized and not abusive in any way.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-202710 alt="Dog Outside In Winter" width=900 height=567 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dog-outside-in-winter.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-202710 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Pexels</span></p><p>Those who run afoul of this new law could face a $300 fine and as much as 90 days in jail. And if any infractions cause bodily harm to the dog, offenders could face a $2,000 fine and a full year in jail.</p><p>Such consequences could also come to those who leave their dog outside for more than half an hour in temperatures greater than 90 degrees Fahrenheit during the summer. However, most of the language in the new law addresses concerns related to cold-weather issues.</p><p>According to Kristen Tullo, Pennsylvania state director of the Humane Society of the United States, “Continuous tethering can cause severe physical damages, such as cracked and bleeding paws, frostbite and hypothermia.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-202712 alt="Dog Panting Outside" width=800 height=784 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dog-panting-outside.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-202712 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Pexels</span></p><p>Attention to such issues in the form of this new law — Libre’s Law —&nbsp;comes in the wake of media attention to the case of a Lancaster County Boston terrier puppy named Libre who was <a href=# rel=noopener>rescued after being severely mistreated</a> at a local farm in 2016.
