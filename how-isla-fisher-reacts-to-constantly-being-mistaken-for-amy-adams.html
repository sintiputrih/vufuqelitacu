"We laugh about it because Amy has blue eyes and I've got brown, our husbands have laughed about it, too," the actor explained.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the coronavirus pandemic has changed all that for her. "I haven't had it for a while, but I think I've been inside my house in COVID for a year," she joked. In fact, Fisher admitted she can't wait to being mistaken for another celebrity if it means she can go out. "Now, to be honest, I look forward to being recognized as anyone," she said. "I look forward to being out and about."</p><p>It seems like Fisher has a great sense of humor about the whole situation.&nbsp;It turns out, she even&nbsp;gets a kick out of the confusion after telling <a href=#>Today</a> in 2016 that she Photoshopped Adams' face onto hers in her family Christmas card and wrote, "Seasons greetings from <a href=#>Sacha [Baron Cohen]</a> and Isla." The best part? Not a single soul noticed. "Everyone was like, 'Oh, your card was so cute.' I was like, 'It was a joke. It's not me, it's Amy!,'" Fisher said at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG9han94e8eormaho6GubrLIrJ%2Beql2nsqKv06xkraddmLyvv9Oapa2kqWKvprXNoGSmoaOprqyxzWadqKpdlrq6ecCdmKarXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./russell-tovey-feud-capote-vs-the-swans-interview-html.html><span>←</span><span>Feuds Russell Tovey on What It Takes to Play a Baddie</span></a>
