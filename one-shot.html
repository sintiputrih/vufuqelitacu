Ferran Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴&nbsp;&nbsp;Line by Line Meaning ↴Let's go
Come at me
It's your boy, King Ferran

I'll carry you any day
King Ferran in the house, I'll clap you any day
Let's go All of y'all hiding in a bush (bush)

Ferran expresses his confidence in himself by proclaiming himself as King Ferran who can "clap you", and "carry you any day". He emphasizes that he is the type of player who is always on the offensive and willing to push forward. He mocks those who hide away in bushes and claims that they cannot compete with his skills. According to Ferran, he hits his shots accurately while others miss like "fish" trying to box.</p><br><p>The middle section of the song emphasizes Ferran's skill in playing Fortnite. He likens himself to Travis Scott, who is known for his impactful performances, and Doja Cat whose song "Say So" garnered a massive following. He uses references to DC Comics superheroes such as Batman to indicate that he is on a winning streak. Furthermore, he mentions that he is the leader of his team, indicating his dominance in the game.</p><br><p>The chorus of the song talks about the intensity of gameplay. Ferran expresses his excitement about playing the game with his squad and how they are "having fun" while building walls and getting rushed. He also talks about the thrill of being in a one versus one situation, where one tap can win the game. The repeated phrase, "One shot," refers to the fact that the player has only one life left, and they need to make it count. Ferran finishes the song by asking for a "sheesh" and showing off his dominance in the game.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Let's go</u><br>Let's get started</p><br><p><u>Come at me</u><br>Bring your best efforts and let's compete</p><br><p><u>It's your boy, King Ferran</u><br>I am the reigning champion, King Ferran</p><br><p><u>Quit hiding</u><br>Stop trying to avoid competing against me</p><br><p><u>You need wins?
