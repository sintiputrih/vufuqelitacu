Kennedy — went one step further and officially endorsed President Biden, who “shares his grandfather’s vision for America” and is “the greatest progressive president we’ve ever had.”</p><p>“President John F. Kennedy is my grandfather, and his legacy is important,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Schlossberg said in an Instagram video</a>. “It’s about public service and courage.”</p><p>The scion, who appeared to be filming in a car, touted some of Biden’s achievements, including “appointing more federal judges than any other president since my grandfather,” and claimed the politician ended the Afghanistan war and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>“And he ended Donald Trump,” the Yale and Harvard grad claimed. “These are the issues that matter, and if my cousin Bobby Kennedy Jr. cared about any of them, he would support Joe Biden, too.</p><p>“Instead, he’s trading in on Camelot, celebrity, conspiracy theories and conflict for personal gain and fame,” he continued.</p><p>“I’ve listened to him. I know him. I have no idea why anyone thinks he should be president. What I do know is, his candidacy is a vanity project.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">JFK’s grandson Jack Schlossberg called RFK Jr.’s 2024 presidential run a “vanity project” that’s “trading in on Camelot, celebrity conspiracy theories and conflict.” <span class=credit>Jack Schlossberg/Instagram</span></figure><p>Schlossberg’s comments come after Kennedy attempted to backtrack on his recent remarks in which he called the COVID-19 pandemic an “ethnically targeted” bioweapon while testifying before the House Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government.</p><p>“COVID-19. There is an argument that it is ethnically targeted. COVID-19 attacks certain races disproportionately,” Kennedy said in a <a href=#>video exclusively obtained by the Post</a>. “COVID-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.</p><p>“We don’t know whether it was deliberately targeted or not but there are papers out there that show the racial or ethnic differential and impact,” Kennedy hedged.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Schlossberg’s comments come after RFK Jr. attempted to backtrack on his recent remarks in which he called the COVID-19 pandemic an “ethnically targeted” bioweapon. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Schlossberg accused his cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of “trading in on Camelot, celebrity conspiracy theories and conflict.”</figure><p>After his remarks drew fierce backlash, Kennedy tweeted that he has “never, ever suggested that the COVID-19 virus was targeted to spare Jews.”</p><p>“I accurately pointed out — during an off-the-record conversation — that the U.S. and other governments are developing ethnically targeted bioweapons and that a 2021 study of the COVID-19 virus shows that COVID-19 appears to disproportionately affect certain races since the furin cleave docking site is most compatible with Blacks and Caucasians and least compatible with ethnic Chinese, Finns, and Ashkenazi Jews, he said.</p><p>The candidate’s sister, Kerry Kennedy, found her brother’s comments <a href=#>“deplorable” and “untruthful.”</a></p><p>“His statements do not represent what I believe or what Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights stand for, with our 50+-year track record of protecting rights and standing against racism and all forms of discrimination,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Bma2pfn66kt4ysmqGkn6jAo7HRoGSbpJGowbR50Z%2BiZqKiYsBufo9ra2aamZl6prrDqKmsnaNir6qwxKdm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-pronounce-utz.html><span>←</span><span>How to pronounce utz</span></a>
