According to royal commentator Neil Sean, who spoke to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>The Daily Express</a>, Markle is determined to keep her Duchess of Sussex title and ensure that her son and daughter, Archie and Lilibet, are offered titles of their own. Sean notes that Meghan has maintained a close relationship with cousins-in-law, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, and sees how they are benefitting from their positions.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sean explains that Meghan had a "dramatic change of heart regarding titles."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Harry and Meghan are very, very keen to cling onto those royal titles. After much deliberation, Meghan decided that the titles would be a good thing, not just for her, but for both her children, too," he said. "Meghan became very friendly with senior members of the monarchy, predominantly Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice. After this, Meghan realized how useful a title can be, particularly when you want to move in the correct circles. That is the reason why they want to clutch hold of titles."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When she spoke to Oprah, Meghan insisted that no matter what, she would always just be Meghan —&nbsp;and a mom. At the time, she brushed off all the pomp and circumstance, saying, “all the grandeur surrounding this stuff is an attachment I don’t personally have. I’ve been a waitress, an actress, a princess, a duchess — I’ve always still just been Meghan, right? I’ve been clear on who I am, independent of all that stuff, and the most important title I’ll ever have is mom. I know that.”<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s really down to the fact that, after befriending Beatrice and Eugenie, she saw how useful those titles are to them,” Sean added, noting that at major events, Prince Harry and Meghan are still introduced as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The issue of titles has been in the headlines lately, especially after sources close to the royals explained that King Charles&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>may not honor his grandchildren with titles</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Royal author Tom Bower told<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>&nbsp;OK</a>&nbsp;that "[Charles] has made various threats to Meghan and Harry and warned them that if they go ahead, they will find themselves ostracized in a way they cannot believe. And so they are worried."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bower finished with a warning of sorts to the Sussexes, explaining, “I do not think their children will get titles if they go ahead and slander the royal family. But they have also got to consider their own titles, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, could be taken away by Charles if they misbehave.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zJ6eoZmeYrqivsqlnGaclamys7nIp5ydZZuasrF50aiwmqRdqba1uMRmbXFqZmiCeA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-franco-siblings-meet-his-two-brothers.html><span>←</span><span>James Franco Siblings: Meet His Two Brothers</span></a>
