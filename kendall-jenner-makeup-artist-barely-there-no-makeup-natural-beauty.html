It should require the least amount of work, with fewer steps, less layering and more focus on natural features. So how is it that we can never get it quite right? Barely-there beauty takes skill to perfect, so if we’re looking for the coveted secret tips, who better to turn to than one of the top makeup artists in the world?</p><p><strong>Mary Phillips</strong> is a go-to makeup guru for the stars, so when she recommends products — including a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">face oil</a>, a long-wear <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">foundation</a> and a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">moisturizer</a> —&nbsp;we’re all over them. Phillips has an untouchable list of A-list clients, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kendall Jenner</strong></a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Chrissy Teigen</strong></a>,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> <strong>Bella Hadid</strong> </a>and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Heidi Klum</strong></a>, but is known for creating Jenner’s famous, flawless natural makeup look!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"> Kiehl’s Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil Herbal Concentrate</a> starting at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$49</a> here! Not into it? See even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">more from Kiehl’s</a> here!</strong></p><p>Phillips explained the key tricks and products to the perfect no-makeup makeup to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Refinery29</a>. After finishing up with skincare, she begins by applying foundation all over the face — but not by itself. She mixes the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">La Mer Soft Fluid Long Wear Foundation</a> with a couple of drops of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Kiehl’s Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil Herbal Concentrate</a> to create a glowing, dewy base!</p><p>“I’m careful not to wipe the skin out. I like it when you can see through to the skin,” Phillips explained, noting that it’s all about starting small and building up with a big, fluffy brush.</p><p>This non-comedogenic Kiehl’s oil, a must for sensitive skin, may help improve the skin’s natural barrier, calm redness and irritation and heal blemishes. When mixed with the weightless La Mer foundation, which not only claims to conceal, but protect our skin with SPF and antioxidants, we have an unstoppable duo!</p><p>We also want to note that this La Mer foundation, which features the brand’s famous Miracle Broth, claims that oxidizing is not an option and that its color will “stay true” even in more extreme weather conditions!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">La Mer Soft Fluid Long Wear Foundation</a> starting at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$120</a> here! Shop even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">more La Mer products</a> here!</strong></p><p>After the foundation and oil comes the moisturizer. What? We already finished with skincare, didn’t we? At this point, we’re already wearing makeup! But that’s just the trick. Phillips has a multitude of purposes for moisturizers like the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Weleda Skin Food Original Ultra-Rich Cream</a>. “The whole point of highlighter is getting that pop of shine, not a stripe,” she said, explaining how she actually uses moisturizer as a highlight to achieve a gorgeous “glow from within!”</p><p>That’s not all. Even if our makeup looks flawless when we leave home, there’s a good chance that by nighttime, the flawless meter will reading lower and lower. That’s when Phillips pulls out this rich and nourishing moisturizer again. “I take some moisturizer, put it on the back of my hand, use a fluffy brush and buff the skin with it. It’s basically like a magic eraser and rehydrates makeup without completely removing anything.” Boom.</p><p>This moisturizing cream can not only be used on the face, but all over the body, too. It’s formulated with essential fatty acids along with vitamin E, which claim to soften skin, as well as organic pansy, which claims to further calm irritation caused by rough and cracking dry patches.</p><p>Now that we have the tools for a barely-there beauty look worthy of supermodel skin, it’s time to make it happen! Don’t forget a tiny bit of mascara for a simple finishing touch!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored">Weleda Skin Food Original Ultra-Rich Cream</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$19</a> here!
