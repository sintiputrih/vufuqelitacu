He was assigned to WWE’s developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) under the ring name Xavier Woods after joining the company in 2010. Woods worked for FCW until he was promoted up to the main roster in 2013 when it was relaunched as NXT.</p><p>Woods, Big E, and <a href=#>Kofi Kingston</a> established The New Day in 2014, and since then, he has won seven SmackDown Tag Team Championships and four Raw Tag Team Championships, giving him an overall record of 11 tag team titles in <a href=#>WWE</a>.

Watson had originally been offered a full-time deal with WWE, but he declined since he still had six months until graduating from college; instead, they decided to let him work part-time until he finished and then offered him a full-time contract after that. Woods made his television debut on the October 31, 2012, edition of NXT, losing to Leo Kruger after WWE renamed its developmental division, FCW, as NXT.</p><p>Woods made his WrestleMania debut on April 6, 2014, at WrestleMania XXX, when he wrestled in the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal but lost. After Big E and Kofi Kingston suffered another setback as a team in a recent streak of defeats, Woods stepped down to speak with them on the July 21 edition of Raw. He went on to say that they couldn’t “go forward by kissing kids and shaking hands,” that now is “their time,” and that he would construct a stable for them. The pair accepted Woods’ offer, and in the next day’s Main Event, Big E and Kingston defeated Heath Slater and Titus O’Neil.</p><p>Woods and his tag team partner Kingston were selected to the SmackDown brand as part of the 2021 Draft, which began on October 22. Prior to that, Woods competed for Raw in the 2021 King of the Ring competition, defeating Ricochet in the first round and Jinder Mahal in the semi-finals. Woods won the tournament and became “King of the Ring” at Crown Jewel on October 21, defeating SmackDown’s Finn Bálor in the final. It was his first solo honour in WWE. The New Day staged a coronation for Woods on the next edition of SmackDown, with the team now officially part of the SmackDown brand.</p><h2>Xavier Woods WWE Achievements</h2><p>4 – time RAW tag team champion</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>7 – time SmackDown tag team champion</p><p>King of The Ring 2021<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-824 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-637 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Xavier Woods Movies</h2><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody><tr><td>Movie Name</td><td>Year</td></tr><tr><td>Escape the Undertaker</td><td>2021</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Xavier Woods’ Wife</h2><p>His wife is Jess Watson and they got married in 2015.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><h2>Why is Xavier Woods not wrestling?</h2><p>In January, Xavier Woods injured his plantar muscle in his calf and was forced to withdraw from the 2022 Royal Rumble PLE.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2Ftb%2FLrqSoZpOkunDD1p5mqaSRrrKzv46xmK%2Bhlad6uLvOnapo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-chiles-net-worth-323544.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Chiles Net Worth</span></a>
