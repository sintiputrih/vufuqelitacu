She grew up in Denville, New Jersey. San Giacomo discovered acting while attending Morris Knolls High School. In 1984, she received a Fine Arts degree, specializing in acting, from Carnegie Mellon School of Drama in <a class=tronLink href=#>Pittsburgh</a>. After graduating, she moved to New York. San Giacomo then went on to appear in several theater productions, including the Garry Marshall-<a class=tronLink href=#>Lowell Ganz</a> production of <i>Wrong Turn at Lungfish</i> in Los Angeles, the Princeton/McCarter Theatre production of <i><a class=tronLink href=#>Three Sisters</a></i>, and off-Broadway in <i>Beirut</i>.

In a review of the <a class=tronLink href=#>Walnut Street Theatre</a> 1986 presentation of <i>As You Like It</i>, San Giacomo received a special mention: "although doll-like Laura San Giacomo had only a minor role as a wilful shepherdess, she sank her fangs into it and received the only show-interrupting applause of the evening."</p><h2 class=alchetronTopicHeaderClass id=Early-career>Early career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/alchetron.com/cdn/laura-san-giacomo-82937c67-99be-4a8f-b4ed-7a2c3e3a16f-resize-750.jpg><p>San Giacomo's first television appearances were four episodes on three television series during 1987. Two notable appearances were in <i>Crime Story</i> in 1988 for the episode "Protected Witness" (Season 2 / Episode 13) as Theresa Farantino, and in <i><a class=tronLink href=#>Miami Vice</a></i> in 1989 for the episode, "Leap of Faith" (Season 5, Episode 19) as Tania Lewis. The <i><a class=tronLink href=#>Miami Vice</a></i> episode also featured a guest appearance by her future husband, actor Cameron Dye, one year before their marriage. Prior to that, she was featured on the daytime soap opera <i><a class=tronLink href=#>All My Children</a></i> as Louisa Sanchez, the Latina common-law wife of Mitch Beck (Brian Fitzpatrick) whose presence threatened to thwart his relationship with Hillary Martin (Carmen Thomas).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/alchetron.com/cdn/laura-san-giacomo-206a9666-ac03-4828-b773-1b6aeb0860d-resize-750.jpeg><p>However, San Giacomo first drew international attention in <a class=tronLink href=#>Steven Soderbergh</a>'s <i>Sex, Lies, and Videotape</i> (1989), which also marked her film debut as a credited actor (in the 1988 movie <i>Miles from Home</i>, her role as "Sandy" was not credited). Her work in the film was nominated for a Golden Globe, and she received a <a class=tronLink href=#>Los Angeles Film Critics Association</a> <i>New Generation Award</i>. The film was honored with the <a class=tronLink href=#>Cannes Film Festival</a>'s prestigious Grand Prize, the <a class=tronLink href=#>Palme d'Or</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/alchetron.com/cdn/laura-san-giacomo-2db75735-5057-417c-8684-7488e340c8c-resize-750.jpeg><p>In 1990, San Giacomo played a supporting role as <a class=tronLink href=#>Julia Roberts</a>' character's wisecracking friend Kit De Luca in <i>Pretty Woman</i>. The <a class=tronLink href=#>blockbuster</a> film ended up generating $178 million at the <a class=tronLink href=#>box office</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/alchetron.com/cdn/laura-san-giacomo-d25fbf68-9d67-4a2c-9279-d9c0725e395-resize-750.jpg><p>San Giacomo has appeared in such films as <i>Miles from Home</i> (1988), <i><a class=tronLink href=#>Quigley Down Under</a></i> (1990), <i>Vital Signs</i> (1990), <i><a class=tronLink href=#>Under Suspicion</a></i> (1991), <i><a class=tronLink href=#>Once Around</a></i> (1991), <i><a class=tronLink href=#>Where the Day Takes You</a></i> (1992), <i>Nina Takes a Lover</i> (1994), and <i><a class=tronLink href=#>Suicide Kings</a></i> (1997). She also appeared as Nadine Cross in the <a class=tronLink href=#>Stephen King</a> TV miniseries <i>The Stand</i> opposite <a class=tronLink href=#>Rob Lowe</a>, which landed them on the cover of the May 7–13, 1994 issue of <i><a class=tronLink href=#>TV Guide</a></i>. She continued doing films, and as 1999 ended, she did the film <i>Eat Your Heart Out</i>. In 2001, San Giacomo landed the starring role in the <a class=tronLink href=#>Jenifer Estess</a> bio-pic <i>Jenifer</i>, which aired on <a class=tronLink href=#>CBS</a> in October of that year.</p><p>San Giacomo did voice work for the animated series <i><a class=tronLink href=#>Gargoyles</a></i> (as the character of Fox).</p><h2 class=alchetronTopicHeaderClass id=Just-Shoot-Me>Just Shoot Me!</h2><p>Needing to work, but not wanting to be away from her newborn son for months at a time, San Giacomo shifted to television in the role of hot-tempered, sassy journalist Maya Gallo in the situation comedy <i>Just Shoot Me!</i> (1997–2003). Her character was partially based on an unproduced idea that executive producer <a class=tronLink href=#>Steven Levitan</a> once had in mind for actress <a class=tronLink href=#>Janeane Garofalo</a> when he was a writer for <i><a class=tronLink href=#>The Larry Sanders Show</a></i>. San Giacomo was originally cast in the starring role, since the series was meant to center on her character; however, the show soon adopted an ensemble style. Despite the shift in focus, San Giacomo remained an integral part of the show and with top billing. She and the four other main cast members appeared in all 148 episodes of the series, which lasted until 2003.</p><p>San Giacomo's work during Season 2 (1997–1998) earned her a <i>Golden Globe</i> nomination in 1998 for Best Actress in a Television Comedy or Musical; the award went to <i>Ally McBeal's</i> Calista Flockhart.</p><h2 class=alchetronTopicHeaderClass id=Post-Just-Shoot-Me-and-appearances>Post-Just Shoot Me! and appearances</h2><p>After NBC cancelled <i>Just Shoot Me!</i> in 2003, San Giacomo appeared sporadically on television and in films. She made guest appearances on several television series, including the short-lived <a class=tronLink href=#>CBS</a> crime drama <i><a class=tronLink href=#>The Handler</a></i> in 2003 and <a class=tronLink href=#>HBO</a>'s <i><a class=tronLink href=#>Unscripted</a></i> in 2005. She was the narrator for the <a class=tronLink href=#>true crime</a> series <i>Snapped: Killer Couples</i> on Oxygen. San Giacomo also appeared in the 2005 films <i><a class=tronLink href=#>Checking Out</a></i> and <i><a class=tronLink href=#>Havoc</a></i>, as well as the 2006 film <i>Conquistadora</i>. San Giacomo was to have made her return to television on The WB's new drama <i><a class=tronLink href=#>Related</a></i> in 2005, but the character was recast due to creative differences. <a class=tronLink href=#>Kiele Sanchez</a> took her place as "Anne Sorelli" on the show. San Giacomo also made few public appearances; she made her first public appearance in nearly a year on 19 October 2005 at the <i>15th Annual <a class=tronLink href=#>Environmental Media Awards</a></i>. She made two more public appearances at the <i>Crystal and Lucy Awards</i> on 6 June 2006 and at the <i>3rd Annual <a class=tronLink href=#>Alfred Mann</a> Foundation Innovation and Inspiration Gala</i> on 9 September 2006.</p><p>In 2006, San Giacomo returned to network television with three guest appearances on the third season of <i><a class=tronLink href=#>Veronica Mars</a></i>. She reunited with her former love interest from <i>Just Shoot Me!</i>, <a class=tronLink href=#>Enrico Colantoni</a>, playing Harmony Chase. Both Colantoni and San Giacomo enjoyed their reunion so much that they lobbied for their characters to appear together in further episodes.</p><p>In September 2006, San Giacomo secured her first starring role on a television program after <i>Just Shoot Me!</i>, when she reunited with a former peer and co-starred opposite fellow Carnegie-Mellon alum Holly Hunter in TNT's drama series <i><a class=tronLink href=#>Saving Grace</a></i>. San Giacomo played Grace's best friend Rhetta Rodriguez.</p><p>In June 2010, San Giacomo guest starred in the episode titled "Death Becomes Her" on the <a class=tronLink href=#>USA network's</a> <i><a class=tronLink href=#>In Plain Sight</a></i>. She played a woman from an organized crime family with a terminal illness. In December 2011, San Giacomo appeared on the episode entitled "Beards" on <i><a class=tronLink href=#>Hot in Cleveland</a></i>, as Caroline, Melanie's estranged sister.</p><h2 class=alchetronTopicHeaderClass id=Personal-life>Personal life</h2><p>San Giacomo has been married twice, first to actor Cameron Dye (1990–98), with whom she had a son, Mason Dye (b. November 19, 1995), who has <a class=tronLink href=#>cerebral palsy</a>, and second to actor Matt Adler (m. 2000). San Giacomo is a cousin of <a class=tronLink href=#>Torry Castellano</a>, former drummer of the rock group <a class=tronLink href=#>The Donnas</a>.</p><p>She lives in the <a class=tronLink href=#>San Fernando Valley</a>, <a class=tronLink href=#>California</a>.

She is also a founder of the CHIME Charter Elementary School, an elementary school in <a class=tronLink href=#>Woodland Hills</a>, California.
