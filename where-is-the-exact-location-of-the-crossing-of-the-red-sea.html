<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Where is the exact location of the crossing of the red sea</h1></header><section class=post-content><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-the-crossing-of-the-red-sea-found-in-the-bible></span>Where is the crossing of the Red Sea found in the Bible?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>When the Israelites reached the Red Sea Moses stretched out his hand and the waters divided, allowing his followers safe passage. The Egyptians followed them but God again commanded Moses to stretch out his hand and the sea engulfed the army. This story is recounted in the Old Testament (<b>Exodus 14: 19-31</b>).<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-red-sea-is-located></span>Where is Red Sea is located?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Its connection to the ocean is in the south, through the Bab el Mandeb strait and the Gulf of Aden. To its north lie the <b>Sinai Peninsula</b>, the Gulf of Aqaba, and the Gulf of Suez (leading to the Suez Canal).<br>…<table><tbody><tr class=ztXv9><th colspan=2 style=text-align:center;padding-left:0>Red Sea</th></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Location</td><td><b>North Africa, East Africa and Western Asia</b></td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Coordinates</td><td>22°N 38°ECoordinates: 22°N 38°E</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Type</td><td>Sea</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-long-did-it-take-for-moses-to-cross-the-red-sea></span>How long did it take for Moses to cross the Red Sea?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>It estimates “<b>less than six hours</b>.” Another answer in quora: How long did Moses and the Israelites walk from one side of the Red Sea to the other side? This one gives “3 hours to cross walking at 4 mph; with livestock and children, maybe eight hours.”<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=which-pharaoh-body-was-found-in-red-sea></span>Which pharaoh body was found in Red Sea?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Pharaoh, <b>Haman</b>, and their army in chariots pursuing the fleeing children of Israel drowned in the Red Sea as the parted water closed up on them. The Pharaoh’s submission to God at the moment of death and total destruction was rejected but his deceased body was saved as a lesson for posterity and he was mummified.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-the-gulf-of-aqaba></span>Where is the Gulf of Aqaba?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Gulf of Aqaba, Arabic Khalīj al-ʿAqabah, <b>northeastern arm of the Red Sea, penetrating between Saudi Arabia and the Sinai Peninsula</b>. It varies in width from 12 to 17 miles (19 to 27 km) and is 110 miles (177 km) long. The gulf lies in a pronounced cleft between hills rising abruptly to about 2,000 feet (600 metres).<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-there-sharks-in-the-red-sea></span>Are there sharks in the Red Sea?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Grey reef sharks</b> are the most commonly spotted species in Egypt’s Red Sea, along with black and whitetip reef sharks which are also often seen.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-did-moses-go-after-crossing-the-red-sea></span>Where did Moses go after crossing the Red Sea?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Midian After killing an Egyptian slave-master who was beating a Hebrew, Moses fled across the Red Sea to <b>Midian</b>, where he encountered the Angel of the Lord, speaking to him from within a burning bush on Mount Horeb, which he regarded as the Mountain of God.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-deep-is-the-red-sea-in-feet></span>How Deep Is the Red Sea in feet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>7,254′ Red Sea/Max depth<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-it-safe-to-swim-in-the-red-sea></span>Is it safe to swim in the Red Sea?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>While the Red Sea generally remains calm, <b>weather conditions will determine your safety</b>. If there are high winds or recent heavy rain, the water could be choppy or visibility might be low, which creates unsuitable conditions for divers.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-deep-is-the-red-sea-where-the-israelites-crossed></span>How deep is the Red Sea where the Israelites crossed?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Research also revealed the Nuweiba “land bridge”, which appears to be a natural formation at a depth of <b>around 33 metres</b> that would allow the Israelites to walk across.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-lives-in-the-red-sea></span>What lives in the Red Sea?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Who lives in the Red Sea?</b><ul class=i8Z77e><li class=TrT0Xe>Common lionfish (Pterois miles) …</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Crocodilefish (Papilloculiceps longiceps) …</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Titan triggerfish (Balistoides viridescens) …</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Bullethead parrotfish (Chlorurus sordidus) …</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Napoleon wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus)= …</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Giant moray (Gymnothorax javanicus) …</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Bluespotted ray (Taeniura lymma)</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-is-the-red-sea-called-the-deceased-sea></span>Why is the Red Sea called the deceased Sea?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The sea is called “dead” <b>because its high salinity prevents macroscopic aquatic organisms</b>, such as fish and aquatic plants, from living in it, though minuscule quantities of bacteria and microbial fungi are present.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-the-red-sea-still-exist></span>Does the Red Sea still exist?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Red Sea compensates for the large water volume it loses each year through evaporation by importing water from the Gulf of Aden—through the narrow Strait of Bab Al Mandeb between Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula and Djibouti and Eritrea on the Horn of Africa. … <b>The Red Sea Eastern Boundary Current exists only in winter.</b><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-the-red-sea-a-lake></span>Is the Red Sea a lake?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>That means that in Drews’ theory, the “Red Sea” or “sea of reeds” of Exodus was actually <b>the Lake of Tanis</b>. The lake “was a shallow brackish lagoon, and that was the ideal place for these papyrus reeds to grow,” says Drews. “So if you want to find a sea of reeds, even today, that’s it.”<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-the-black-sea></span>Where is the Black Sea?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Black Sea is located at <b>the southeastern extremity of Europe</b>. It is bordered by Ukraine to the north, Russia to the northeast, Georgia to the east, Turkey to the south, and Bulgaria and Romania to the west.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-sea-water-is-salty></span>Why sea water is salty?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Salt in the sea, or ocean salinity, is <b>mainly caused by rain washing mineral ions from the land into water</b>. … When rain falls, it weathers rocks, releasing mineral salts that separate into ions. These ions are carried with runoff water and ultimately reach the ocean.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-at-the-bottom-of-the-deceased-sea></span>What is at the bottom of the deceased Sea?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>These are <b>freshwater springs</b>, jetting into the bottom of the deceased Sea from inside craters. Found as deep as 100 feet from the surface, the springs lie at the base of craters as large as 50 feet wide and 65 feet deep. … The springs roil the waters they flow into in a phantasmal slipstream.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-country-is-the-caspian-sea-in></span>What country is the Caspian sea in?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Caspian Sea is the largest inland body of water in the world and accounts for 40 to 44% of the total lacustrine waters of the world. The coastlines of the Caspian are shared by <b>Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan</b>.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46wn56qlWK2tHnToZxmnaiWsLV5y6iamqyZpLtuu8Vmq6GdXZi%2FsL%2FSoqWgZZ%2BberW0xGapnpxdqLKiew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./russell-wilson-likes-patrick-mahomes-post-denver-broncos-benching.html><span>←</span><span>Russell Wilson likes post claiming he has 'outplayed' Patrick Mahomes just hours after reports Bronc</span></a>
