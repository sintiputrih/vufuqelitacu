But there are only three people on Earth who get to call Dennis ‘Dad’ in real life — his three kids! And two of them, just like The Parent Trap, are twins.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Dennis-Quaids-Kids-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Dennis, who was recently <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in the news</a> for saying he’d like to make Texas the film capital of the world, has been married four times, and even dated <strong>Travis Barker</strong>‘s ex-wife <strong>Shanna Moakler</strong> for a short time in 2001. After a marriage to scream queen<strong> P.J. Soles</strong> (of<strong> John Carpenter</strong>‘s iconic Halloween) ended in 1983, Dennis married ’90s darling <strong>Meg Ryan </strong>of You’ve Got Mail.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The couple had their son Jack in 1992. Sadly, he and Meg went their separate ways in 2001, and he married real estate agent<strong> Kimberly Buffington</strong> in 2004. Kimberly and Dennis happily welcomed fraternal twins together in 2007 via a surrogate — one boy and one girl. Dennis is now married to brilliant Ph.D. student <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Laura Savoie</a></strong>. Here’s what you need to know about all three of Dennis’ kids!</p><h2>Jack Quaid</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dennis-quaid-jack-quaid-ss-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Dennis’ oldest child<strong> Jack Henry Quaid</strong> has followed in both his father’s and mother’s acting footsteps with a similar career of his own! Jack was born in Los Angeles in 1992 and attended the Tish School of the Arts at NYU. Jack first appeared in a small role as Marvel in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hunger Games</a> in 2012 but broke out for real as Hughie Campbell in Amazon Prime Video’s superhero-themed series The Boys. He showed up in HBO television series <i>Vinyl </i>in 2016 and in Steven Soderbergh’s&nbsp;<i>Logan Lucky </i>in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>And it appears that Jack is still on the fast track to being like his father and Oscar-winning uncle <strong>Randy Quaid</strong>. He was cast as a voice actor in CBS All Access animated series Star Trek: Lower Decks;&nbsp;has a role in fifth Scream movie alongside franchise mainstays <strong>Courtney Cox</strong> and <strong>Neve Campbell</strong>; and will appear in <strong>Christopher Nolan</strong>‘s historical drama Oppenheimer in 2023!</p><h2><span><span>Zoe Grace Quaid</span></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Dennis-Quaids-Kids-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Three years after Dennis tied the knot with Texas real estate agent <strong>Kimberly Buffington</strong>, the couple became parents to a perfect pair of fraternal twins. <strong>Zoe Grace Quaid</strong> is the actor’s only daughter, and judging by his photos with her, she’s become quite the daddy’s girl!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Born alongside Thomas in sunny Santa Monica, California on November 8, 2007, Zoe had a medical mishap when she was mistakenly given a high dose of blood thinner Heparin. She recovered from the highly public incident and is a healthy teen today; no word yet on whether she will sell homes or become a famous actress.</p><h2><span><span>Thomas Quaid</span></span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>Thomas Boone Quaid</strong> was also born November 8, 2007 at St. John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, California. He, too, was affected by the Heparin incident at just 10 days old.
