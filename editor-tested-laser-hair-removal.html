I'm truly not sure how I made it this far in life without getting it done.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">My only frame of reference for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>laser hair removal</a> was a friend who had it done in 2011, and I recalled her complaining about how much it hurt, so on the way to my first appointment at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>LaserAway</a>. I was so terrified that I was shaking, but I reminded myself that beauty is pain! (Also, the technology has advanced a lot since then, at least that's what I convinced myself.) And I was so over the hassle of shaving, especially considering I have such sensitive skin, so the time had come to finally try it.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-laser-hair-removal-feels-like></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Laser Hair Removal Feels Like</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I arrived at the offices and was greeted by Paula Acosta, a registered nurse, who brought me into my room. We talked about where I'd be getting treatments (underarm and Brazilian). She handed me a robe to wear, protective eyewear, and then it was time to go.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>LaserAway</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's where things got awkward. The only thing that hurt during the whole procedure was my ego—I cannot stress how uncomfortable I was having a stranger all up in my business. Especially when you have to contort to make sure all the areas are reached (use your imagination here). My heart was pounding out of my chest. But Paula—a former trauma nurse!—and her calming demeanor put me totally at ease and reminded me that she sees so many naked patients in a day, there is nothing she hasn't seen before. Phew.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The procedure itself takes just minutes, and there is NO pain. I know that's hard to believe, but it's a fact. All you feel is the cool air from the laser that simultaneously blows on you while you're getting zapped. Your nurse will take care to hit each and every area, but it goes by very quickly. If it freaks you out, you can hold a stress ball, but I was happy just chatting with Paula about life and watching the Kardashians on the giant TV screen. Not only do you need to come completely hairless to your appointment, but Paula also advised that it's super important to be freshly <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hair-free </a>and to take your time shaving or waxing, as any leftover hair burning is the only thing that hurts (so definitely shave the day of your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>appointment</a>, and even better if its two hours before.)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-long-it-takes></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Long It Takes</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's that easy! You're in and out in a flash. You visit once every six weeks and depending on your skin tone and hair texture, you will need to complete around six to eight sessions total. The only post-treatment restrictions are no showering in super hot water for a few days, no working out for 24 hours due to the friction, and no shaving for a week.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And that's it—then you're hair-free for life. But wait ... if it's that easy, why doesn't everyone do it? "The only reason someone wouldn't do it today is that they simply aren't aware of how well it works," Paula told me.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-much-laser-hair-removal-for-the-bikini-costs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Much Laser Hair Removal for the Bikini Costs</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That, and the cost is a factor too. At LaserAway, it varies from $99-$599 per treatment, depending on the area. But since you need eight sessions, it's more cost-effective to purchase a package, which for the Brazilian area is $1,794. The total laser hair removal bikini cost, meanwhile, is slightly less.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But factor in how much you'd spend in a lifetime on razors and waxing, and think about the cost-per-wear for LHR (literally, hair-free for life), and it seems like a downright steal. And the convenience of never having to worry about shaving again is literally priceless.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLKltdOoqWaslajBprCMpZisnaJitaK10WapnqWfq66t</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amd-announces-radeon-pro-wx-3100-wx-2100.html><span>←</span><span>AMD Announces Radeon Pro WX 3100 &amp;amp; WX 2100: Entry-Level Polaris Pro Cards</span></a>
