However, investigators stated that they never found evidence of the fleeing men returning fire.</p><p>Rudolph was the leading receiver for Florida State in 2015 and 2016. He departed the team early to enter the NFL draft in 2017.</p><p>He eventually signed with the New York Giants and later with the Miami Dolphins. He also had a stint with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the Canadian Football League, but the team released him after his arrest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Former-NFL-player-Travis-Rudolph-found-not-guilty-of-murder.jpg><p>In 2016, he garnered national attention for a video of him having lunch with an autistic student during a team visit to a middle school in Tallahassee. The student’s mother, Leah Paske, posted the video, which went viral, mentioning that her “super sweet child” often ate alone.</p><p>“I asked if I could sit next to him, and he said ‘Sure, why not?'” Rudolph stated to reporters in 2016. “I just felt like we had a great conversation. He started off and was so open. He told me his name was Bo and how much he loves Florida State, and he went from there.”</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmidqKqdmr9uusWlZKmkka6ys3nTq5ivoaNiv7awzqWnoWWWpMKvsIynpq1ll6q2rcDYZqafZZ2qv6Wx0WaYrGWaqr%2B6ecCgqZ6dXZ2ybq3CrZydZZmjerSxy59knZ2Wmru0sYyipWZqYGd%2BbrLArZilZaOdvLDAyKeeaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./does-tom-brady-own-a-pickleball-team.html><span>←</span><span>Does Tom Brady own a Pickleball team?</span></a>
