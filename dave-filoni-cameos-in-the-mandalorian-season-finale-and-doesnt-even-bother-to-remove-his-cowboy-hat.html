Recommended Videos Dave Filoni is currently living his dream life. The lifelong Star Wars fan is now the major creative force behind the franchise, steering The Mandalorian to success, giving his favorite character Ahsoka Tano her own live-action series, and is soon to be directing his very own ‘Mandoverse’ theatrical movie.
Along the way, he hasn’t been shy about turning up in person."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

In The Mandalorian season two he played New Republic X-Wing pilot Trapper Wolf, and has now reprised the role in a brief appearance in the season three finale. But this time he hasn’t even taken the time to remove his trademark cowboy hat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chrome_gywR64PmPI.png><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=589 data-injectable=true>Hi Dave, we all see you back there. It’s probably worth underlining (as we’re sure Filoni is more than aware) that cowboy hats are indeed canon to Star Wars. One notable fan is bounty hunter Cad Bane, who was sporting one in his live-action appearance in The Book of Boba Fett.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>While some might criticize this for being a teeny bit self-indulgent, we think Filoni has earned the odd cameo here and there for his work rehabilitating Star Wars after the dreadful The Rise of Skywalker. Let’s just hope his editorial control doesn’t go to his head, or we may see a Trapper Wolf spinoff show about his heroic X-Wing adventures before too long.</p><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=607 data-injectable=false>Fortunately, he’s got a full plate with putting the finishing touches to Ahsoka and beginning work on his live-action theatrical debut, so at least for now he’ll be spending more time behind the camera than in front of it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8OarZ5llp65sLrIZpqapZWkwG61zWaroZ1doq6vsMClpquhkaN6tLHArKanZZaeu6K4xGaYp5xdmbymv82tZJ6ulaN6o7vToZyrZaSkerOxzKitnmWYnsBur86wmaixXZ2utXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./camille-mcdonald.html><span>←</span><span>Camille McDonald</span></a>
