Explored<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>DeMar DeRozan took his fans by surprise when he stepped out with a new&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Joker tattoo&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>on his shoulder back in 2019.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Though he has not formally spoken on his tattoo and the meaning behind it, it is clear that the Bulls star cherishes it.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It seems that DeRozan is a big fan of the Joker character introduced to the world by DC Comics.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The late actor Heath Ledger portrayed the Joker inked on DeRozan’s right shoulder.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Meanwhile, he inked the tattoo in the wake of the 2019 movie Joker that actor Joaquin Phoenix portrays.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Even so, it is for sure that DeRozan cherishes Joker more precisely due to the mental tension of the character.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>DeRozan suffers from depression and is an avid advocate against it.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Thus, the similarity of longing for mental health stability of both the Joker and himself prompted DeRozan to get a tattoo of Joker on his body.</span></p><h2 id=demar-derozan-tattoo-is-it-some-kind-of-gang-sign><span class=ez-toc-section id=demar-derozan-tattoo-is-it-some-kind-of-gang-sign></span> DeMar DeRozan Tattoo- Is It Some Kind Of Gang Sign?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>DeMar DeRozan’s tattoo does not scream any kind of gang sign.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As mentioned above, DeRozan’s choice of the Joker ink is rather connected with the Joker character and the movie’s popularity.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Thus, the NBA player showcases his love for the character through ink.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Linking the tattoo to gang signs may not be considerate from any angle.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It is for sure that DeRozan is not the first one to ink himself with a Joker portrait as the DC villain is idolized by many.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Even so, he cherishes his ink by often displaying it on pictures on his social media handles, especially&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Instagram</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, per our sources, his Joker tattoo falls under some of the best NBA tattoos of payers.</span></p><p class=postsid
