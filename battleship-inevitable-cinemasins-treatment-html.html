But then, avoiding redundancies isn’t something humanity is known for.</p><p>CinemaSins are the YouTubers who rip popular big-budgeted movies apart for their “sins,” and while films like these always have factual errors for people to point out, a liberal dose of humor and opinions are thrown into these videos. But again, it’s fucking <i>Battleship</i>, possibly the biggest action cliché to ever exist, replacing the dumb enjoyment – was it even that? – of <i><a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="The Expendables" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>The Expendables</a></i> films with more unbelievable junk. For better or worse, here is “Everything Wrong With <i>Battleship</i> in 6 Minutes or Less.”</p><p><span id=more-51263></span></p><p>To speak nothing of Taylor Kitsch’s skills as an actor, his Alex Hopper character clearly takes one of the most brain-defying arcs in cinema. And for all the star power this film somehow boasted, it relied mostly on over-wrought dialogue and CGI wizardry. But hey, it makes for great viewing when you’ve got a glass of popcorn and a big old tub of vodka handy. No butter in the vodka please.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irk56zqnvBmqutpJWotaq8jKKlnq6Zqa6juMRmmqKmlaKutLXNrGStqpWWwa6xza1loaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./deion-sanders.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Deion Sanders dating?
