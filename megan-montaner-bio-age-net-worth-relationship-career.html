She used to do makeup for a lot of actors and models. Her interest in that field grew fast as well. As a result, Megan decided to try her hand at acting. She made her acting debut as Leticia in the 2010 season of Eva’s Fishbowl.</p><p>That year, she also created two more TV series, Love is Forever and Flight IL8714. People immediately began to take notice of her acting ability. She played Pepa Aguirre in The Mystery of Puente Viejo. During its span from 2011 to 2014, the actress appeared in 98 episodes.</p><p>Furthermore, she spent the most time in this role during her whole career. During this period, she also worked on several other productions, including Grand Hotel and Tormenta. Megan, on the other hand, decided to try her luck on the big screen in 2014. Fortunately, she landed the role of Adela in Gods and Dogs.</p><p>Megan also appeared in the 2014 film For a Handful of Kisses. Then, three years later, in 2017, she appeared in the film Lord, Give Me Patience. Megan has only acted in three films so far because, as much as her fans adore her, she is more of a silver-screen queen. She has also been in around fifteen television series, but there is still more work to be done.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Details>Social Media Details</span></h2><p>Megan Gracia often uses Instagram and Twitter.
