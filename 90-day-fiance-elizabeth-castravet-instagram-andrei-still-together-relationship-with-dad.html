Like, meet on the phone or face-to-face? So my answer was different and they were like, 'That's not the right answer.' I was like, 'This is my husband. I know when we met. I was there'" according to People.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though there are still some challenges in Andrei and Elizabeth's relationship, they seem like they want to stick together and get through it.
