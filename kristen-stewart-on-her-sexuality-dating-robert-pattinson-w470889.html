I hated it that details of my life were being turned into a commodity and peddled around the world. But considering I had so many eyes on me, I suddenly realized [my private life] affects a greater number of people than just me. It was an opportunity to surrender a bit of what was mine, to make even one other person feel good about themselves.”</p><p>Stewart elaborated that she tried to keep her romance with the British actor, 30, private, but the constant media attention made that difficult. “When I was dating Rob, the public were the enemy — and that is no way to live,” she explained. “It wasn’t this grand statement, ‘I was so confused! Now I’ve realized who I am!’ I have not been struggling.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kristen-stewart-robert-pattinson-inline-0532fd2e-22fa-49b3-8ca7-e67c973f52e1.jpg><p>So, why did the <i>Snow White and the Huntsman</i> star decide to come out publicly? “It just seemed important, and topical,” she said.</p><span class=caption></span><p>Stewart and Pattinson called it quits on their four-year relationship in July 2012 after <i>Us Weekly</i> published exclusive photos of the actress kissing her <i>Snow White</i> director <b><a href=#>Rupert Sanders</a></b>. Stewart and Pattinson later gave their love another try, but ended things once again in 2013.
