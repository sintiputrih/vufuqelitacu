Of course, we’ve all had an imaginary friend at one point or another, but when that imaginary friend appears supernatural and clearly harbors sinister intentions beyond our wildest imaginations, then it’s probably time to toss it in the garbage can.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=206 data-current-count=206 data-injectable=false>Nevertheless, with the spine-tingling horror project releasing in theaters today, March 8, spooky supporters are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rubbing their hands together in anticipation</a> of knowing how exactly this horror venture ends.</p><h2 id=h-the-ending-of-imaginary-explained data-injectable=false>The ending of Imaginary, explained</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>Much like other supernatural teddy bears, toys, or dolls in other horror projects, it is revealed that Chauncey is not just an inanimate object. Rather, the teddy bear is controlled by an evil, supernatural entity that feeds on the innocence and naïveté of young children. Basically, the entity is like Bughuul from Sinister, only Chauncey is definitely more adorable — at least appearance wise.</p><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=760 data-injectable=true>When Jessica was a child, the demonic presence controlling Chauncey was adamant on stealing pieces of Jessica’s soul and keeping her in a horrific dimension called the Never Ever. However, Jessica was able to avoid being trapped in the horrifying unknown, with the supernatural entity unable to control her any longer once she moved out of her childhood home.</p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=false>Desperate, the entity attaches itself to Jessica’s stepdaughter Alice, although the duo are both able to escape the wrath of the entity by setting Jessica’s childhood home on fire and letting the disastrous memories burn. In the end, the duo encounter another teddy bear at a hotel that resembles Chauncey, hinting at the idea that the fire likely didn’t work, and that the entity is still out there looking for new souls to trap.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKaZl567or7YZqSorpmaeqa6w6KloGWVrb2trcinnJ1n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./family-feud-contestant-on-trial-for-wifes-murder-after-joking-about-marriage-regret.html><span>←</span><span>Family Feud contestant on trial for wifes murder after joking about marriage regret</span></a>
