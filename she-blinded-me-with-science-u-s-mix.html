Thomas Dolby Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴It's poetry in motion
She turned her tender eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
As sweet as any harmonyMm, but she blinded me with science
She blinded me with science
And failed me in biology, yeah-yeah Now-uh, huh-huh
When I'm dancing close to her
Blinding me with science, science
ScienceI can smell the chemicals
Blinding me with science, science"><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Her eyes are deep and sweet like an ocean and harmony. However, he goes on to say that she blinded him with science and failed him in biology and geometry. Yet, despite her academic shortcomings, she continues to captivate him. Dolby describes how he can smell chemicals and hear machinery when he's near her, adding to the sense of sensory overload she creates. The second verse takes things to another level as Dolby suggests that she's making love to him and that the "spheres are in commotion" and the "elements in harmony." He again references her blinding him with science but this time adds that she hit him with technology. Dolby then voices his disbelief in the beautiful Miss Sakamoto as she tidies up his scientific equipment and notes.<br></p><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Warner Chappell Music, Inc.<br>Written by: Jonathan Kerr, Thomas Dolby</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maIyYpLqiv759pqWaqWSgqbG%2Be6OippSasaCZxJiOoqyYlKCktcSnmp6XWIp7lHq%2BpqCxYQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./md-patrick-brophy-cause-and-death-how-did-doctor-die.html><span>←</span><span>MD Patrick Brophy Cause And Death: How Did Doctor Die?</span></a>
