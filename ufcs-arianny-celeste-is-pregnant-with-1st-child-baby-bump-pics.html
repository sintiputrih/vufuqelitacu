The Las Vegas native found out about her pregnancy in January and has felt “a mix of nervousness and excitement” ever since.</p><p>“My mom for&nbsp;some reason asked me to take a&nbsp;pregnancy test,” Celeste tells&nbsp;Us. “[Moms] always seem to know. I went to the store and got two tests and sure enough, I was pregnant. I couldn’t&nbsp;wait, so I called my boyfriend immediately even though he was working at&nbsp;the time.”</p><p>Since then, the model has been “reading every book possible” ahead of their little one’s arrival.</p><p>“From what to eat, how to sleep train and hypnobirthing, I want to be as informed as possible to have a harmonious journey with my baby,” the mom-to-be adds. “I’m&nbsp;determined to focus on the&nbsp;wonderful [and] empowering experience of birthing life to&nbsp;my&nbsp;first child.”</p><p>When it comes to her pregnancy symptoms, Celeste was “super tired” during her first trimester, but got her energy back around week 14. “Thankfully, I&nbsp;wasn’t&nbsp;too sick or nauseous,” she explains. “I crave fruit and meat. I’m not&nbsp;usually a meat eater and I stick to a mostly vegan diet, but during pregnancy I’ve given&nbsp;in to occasionally eating things like In-N-Out or pizza.”</p><p>The Overhaulin‘ cohost is looking forward to <a href=#>her hospital birth</a> with her boyfriend’s “calming” energy. “I feel safe, yet confident [during] this scary time,” Celeste says, referencing the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>In May, the pregnant star gave a shout-out to her own mom via Instagram, writing, “To my mama, my hero, my strength. I love u. Thank you for being my best friend even when Im not deserving and I act like a lil [s—t]. (Still do sometimes). Happy <a href=#>Mother’s Day</a>, we love you so much.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Celeste’s maternity shoot, from PDA pictures to solo shots.</p><p>With reporting by Brody Brown</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkwqev0maYq6GRo7u6ecKeo56rpJp6qr%2BMqamen56Wu7V51qKroWVhqMFur8eio51lkpavunnBrqSpZaCesLR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tiffany-chen-5-things-to-know-about-robert-de-niros-girlfriend.html><span>←</span><span>Tiffany Chen: 5 Things to Know About Robert De Niro's Girlfriend</span></a>
