Specifically, it's a gray shirt that reads "Sex Ed," which surely set off some online users and spectators who take issue with their age gap (Michele is 39, Green is 22, and they started dating when he was 21). Needless to say, their relationship became the subject of a lot of debate and discussion online, something that the actress and designer seems particularly annoyed with or confused by. Moreover, she took to her Instagram Story with a message for all the folks acting pressed over pictures of the two, be it for their fits or their gap.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"There is no picture or video on this app that could set me off in comments the way pics and videos of me do to people," Draya Michele expressed. "It's strange. I be wanting to know does your man, bestie, mom, employer know you just be serial typing negative s**t on here? Self evaluation–- what did that comment do for me? Anyway. I simply don't look at <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">things that upset me or could trigger me</a> to spiral in a frenzy of negative thoughts. Try that."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-draya-michele-s-message-for-the-haters>Draya Michele's Message For The Haters</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Elsewhere, Draya Michele announced <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the birth of her daughter with Jalen Green</a> and paid tribute to her late father at the same time. "In 2021 on Mother’s Day, my dad passed away," she expressed in an Instagram post. "Since then, it’s been extremely hard to celebrate that day without remembering the earth shattering phone call I received that morning. Well, this Mother’s Day was different. My daughter was safely brought into this world and I’m forever grateful for&nbsp;the new memories we all get to experience&nbsp;moving forward. Love + Light everyone."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, Draya Michele's <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">post-pregnancy body</a> also caught fans' eyes as of late, adding to gossip and conversation around the couple. We can't really guess how this will evolve in the future, but we'd say it's more likely than not that people will keep commenting on anything they do. For the couple's sake, hopefully they learn to block out the haters, take their criticism into serious account, or find a way to balance everything. Keeping up with critique can be exhausting, but let's not pretend it should be difficult for celebrities.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdoZoBzgJdmm6uZqZZ6rrXCoZylnV2frq2xzWaeq52Vo3qurdOcn6Kml2K8tsDFoqusZaKawLG7zaycZqifpXqkwcutrKudXaOyuL8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./american-airlines-flight-woman.html><span>←</span><span>American Airlines Flight Woman Freaks Out On An Aircraft About A Not Real Person</span></a>
