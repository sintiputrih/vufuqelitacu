Both his father and older brother were music-oriented, something which certainly rubbed off on Fender. Early on he was given a guitar which he took little time in becoming proficient in. “I love guitars.” He said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Radio X</a> in 2021, “I play loads of guitars. It’s still early days of the guitar collection but I’m hoping that in about 10 years I have a stupid collection.”</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>He’s very unpretentious when citing his influences, as he doesn’t understand people who claim they “listened to Leonard Cohen when [they were] seven.” He’s cited, among others, Green Day and Bruce Springsteen as some of his influences.</p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=496 data-injectable=true>He’s been through some rough patches during the first two decades of his life. He had to give up on his A-levels to help his mother who was suffering from Fibromyalgia and later developed a mental disorder in connection to the difficult disease.</p><p data-characters=167 data-current-count=167 data-injectable=false>Thankfully Fender’s chance to give a new route to his life came when he was spotted by Ben Howard’s manager Owain Davis while he was performing at a small pub.</p><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=false>Although he has had some problems with his health, which has forced him to take time off, Fender’s career has only taken off from there and, with the anticipated new single coming soon, Fender will continue to solidify his name in the UK rock scene, and hopefully, with this new collaboration, his name will also receive a push to widen his fanbase around the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46wn6hlmah6tK3MZp2eppSav3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-danielle-kang-boyfriend-her-relationship-details.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is American Professional Golfer Danielle Kang Dating In 2021?
