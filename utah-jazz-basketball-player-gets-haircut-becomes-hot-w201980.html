But that doesn’t mean his teammates don’t rib him a bit. Hayward says they “just make fun of me the whole time,” for his new chop and facial hair.</p><span class=caption></span><p><i>Which style do you think suits Gordon best?</i></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6rBorSMo5izsl2XrrS3xK2ZmqScYr2trdieqWaflanAbrTAoqmcraRir6avzqacrGWYpMFuw5FpaHJwYGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./there-will-be-no-new-emoji-next-year-due-to-the-coronavirus-html.html><span>←</span><span>There Will Be No New Emoji Next Year Because of the Coronavirus</span></a>
