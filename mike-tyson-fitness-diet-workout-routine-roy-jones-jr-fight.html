Mike, 54, is scheduled to take on <strong>Roy Jones Jr. </strong>in an eight-round exhibition match on Nov. 28, the first sanctioned match for “the Baddest Man On The Planet” in about fifteen years (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>watch it here on FITE</a>). Though Mike retired professionally in 2005, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>you wouldn’t know that</a> by looking at his Instagram. The former undisputed heavyweight champion of the world looks <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>just fast and powerful</a> as he did when he was knocking out opponents in the 1980s and ‘90s.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“I’m keeping my focus on this fight,” Tyson tells <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>. It’s been fifteen years since his last professional fight (his bout against <strong>Kevin McBride</strong>), and Tyson says he’s “going to go out there, ready for anything.” The event — which takes place at Los Angeles’ STAPLES Center and will feature performances from <strong>YG, Wiz Khalifa, French Montana, </strong>and <strong>DaBaby</strong> – will also raise money for charity. Mike, who has his Mike Tyson Cares Foundation, says that his portion of the purse will be distributed to a few different charitable organizations.<br>Ahead of the fight, Mike took time to share his fitness and diet routine with <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>.

I spent most of my time being in condition. I have been very disciplined with my diet, my mind, and my training.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>What did you do to train differently than your everyday routine?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>I focused more on duration, going longer distances. Running as much as possible, listening to my body, and knowing when to rest and when to push. I’m smarter in my approach and feel pretty much invincible.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>What have you been eating for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>I have been abstaining from sugar and focusing on a high protein diet. Lots of egg whites, green salads, fish, goat, and cashews for a snack.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>How much water are you drinking?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>A lot of water. I only drink water and sometimes have a no sugar Zevia cream soda drink for flavor. But other than that, I’m only drinking water and hot teas.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12><strong>Did you give up any foods or treats to train?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Absolutely. I gave up sugar. Not a cookie, which I love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/mike-tyson-reveals-working-out-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14><strong>How much are you working out to prepare?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Six days a week. I rest on Sundays usually, but even on my rest day, I’m still doing something. I have so much energy and feel so good. It’s hard to keep still.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16><strong>Are you already thinking of another fight?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-17>I’m keeping my focus on this fight. It’s been 15 years, and I’m going to go out there ready for anything. I can’t think of anything right now but this fight.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18><strong>Who would you love to fight next?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-19>I’ll leave that up to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>!</p><p id=content-paragraph-20><strong>How have you been preventing injury?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-21>Most importantly, listening to my body when it tells me to rest. Sometimes rest is the best training when your body is telling you that it needs that. But I stretch, get massages, soak in hot Epsom salt baths, do dry saunas and rejuvenate my muscles before and after a workout with Neufit.</p><p id=content-paragraph-22><strong>What’s the meal you’re going to have as soon as you’re done?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-23>I don’t know. Maybe some kind of pasta.</p><p id=content-paragraph-24><strong>How do you feel?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-25>I feel invincible and calm.</p><p id=content-paragraph-26><strong>How many hours a day are you training?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-27>I’m training for about 6 hours a day.</p><p id=content-paragraph-28><strong>Do you get a day off?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-29>I get a day off when I need it. I’m the boss.</p><p id=content-paragraph-30><strong>What’s next for you after this?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-31>The sky is the limit.</p><p id=content-paragraph-32>Watch Tyson vs. Jones live stream online on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>FITE.tv</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ye5FwZqahm5p6tcXSqKVmnpmpu6a%2F0mabop2kYsSwvsqorK1loqTCtbXNnmSrp6lit7C6xKxko6pdm7aotNNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katey-sagal.html><span>←</span><span>Katey Sagal Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</span></a>
