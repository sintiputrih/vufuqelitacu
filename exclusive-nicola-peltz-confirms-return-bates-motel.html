After breaking out on A&E’s excellent <a href=#><strong>Bates Motel</strong></a>, her character departed the show early on in season two. While many fans were left disappointed, it was assumed that the actress wanted to focus on her film career and would not be returning.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>In fact, <a href=#>we sat down with Peltz about a month ago</a> and asked if we might ever see her back on Bates Motel. While she teased that we might, she wouldn’t confirm anything one way or another. This week, however, the actress seems to have had a change of heart.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=599 data-injectable=true>Our very own Matt Donato landed an exclusive interview with Peltz for her new movie Affluenza and asked her about any future projects that she had in the pipeline. Among other things, she confirmed a return to the hit A&E series, saying “…and I’m going back on Bates [Motel], so I’m excited about that.”</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>If that’s not official confirmation, then I don’t know what is. We have yet to hear anything from the network, but Peltz is obviously in the know. If she says she’s coming back, then fans should expect to see Bradley Martin make a return to White Pine Bay when the show starts up again for its third season in early 2015.</p><p data-characters=103 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true>Tell us, are you a fan of <strong>Bates Motel</strong>?
