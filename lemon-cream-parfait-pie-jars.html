When I look at her life though and how she spends her time, the majority of it is in the service of others. She is found putting together a care package for her grandkids or making a baked good for her neighbors. She is as sweet as they come and has a heart of gold. Her genuine kindness is something that I have always admired and love about her. I am so grateful for my wise mama who has taught me enough to fill a book and then some! Happy Mother’s Day, Mom.

Stir in powdered sugar and vanilla and mix for 30 seconds longer. This method works but you do have to scrape the bowl a few times to incorporate the cream cheese. I found the whipped cream to not be as fluffy with this method but it sure tastes good!</p><p><strong>*EXTRA STEP METHOD:</strong> In a medium bowl, whip the cream cheese for 4 minutes and add powdered sugar and vanilla and mix for 1 minute longer. &nbsp;In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until firm peaks form. &nbsp;Fold in the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture. &nbsp;This will allow them to whip separately to create the most volume. This is an extra step and one more bowl to clean but it does make a difference in the volume and fluffiness of the cream.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/DSC_0945-copy2.jpg alt="Lemon Cream Parfait Pie Jars.
