So, let’s begin.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>For starters, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 premiered last weekend to raucous applause from both critics and fans. The long-awaited threequel bid farewell not just to the band of ragtag superheroes fans like myself have come to love since 2014, but also to the franchise’s director, James Gunn, who will now be spearheading DC Studios’ cinematic efforts.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=799 data-injectable=true>The MCU’s undeniable popularity notwithstanding, this particular franchise — Guardians of the Galaxy — has harbored an undeniably special place in fans’ hearts. The film’s somewhat uncharacteristically emotional conclusion, by effect, has resulted in a mass exodus of moviegoers walking out of theaters with puffy eyes and tear stains tracking down their cheeks. The reason? Rocket Racoon’s backstory, of course.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>Adulation for the character and his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">triumphantly heartbreaking backstory</a> resulted in one fan taking a trip down to the tattoo parlor to honor the character in perhaps the most permanent way possible — by getting his name tattooed on his arm. Not “Rocket Raccoon.” His other name: 89P13.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=592 data-injectable=true><a title=@soyalyssalopez href=#>@soyalyssalopez</a><p>Se traumó con <a title=guardianesdelagalaxia href=#>#GuardianesdelaGalaxia</a></p><a title="♬ Dog Days Are Over - Florence + The Machine" href=#>♬ Dog Days Are Over – Florence + The Machine</a></figure><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>Those who have seen the film immediately recognize the string of numbers. Put together, they represent the name Rocket was given by the merciless geneticist, High Evolutionary, played by Chukwudi Iwuji. Abducted, tortured, and experimented on, we learn that Rocket forged his own name because up until that point he was simply known as 89P13, the string of letters fans are now urging others not to get tattooed on their arms for… obvious reasons.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Just a friendly reminder to all my <a href=#>#GotGVol3</a> fans:</p><p>Please do not get a tattoo of rocket’s number on your arm… this is so incredibly insensitive to holocaust survivors… <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/fYj0PQnfn5</a></p>— Hanukkah Samuel 🕎⚡️🐍 (@lokiwhoreera) <a href=#>May 10, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>https://twitter.com/Aiminska/status/1656705637542248464</figure><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>The thrill of getting a tattoo combined with overwhelming love for a character in a movie or TV show is typically the reason fans brand themselves with this permanent method of adoration. It happened with Harry Potter. It happened with Game of Thrones. It even happened with Stranger Things. While the underlying intention may be pure, the genesis of the issue is not, and it needs to be spelled out if only to prevent it from continuing to happen.</p><p data-characters=495 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>The history of tattooed numbers on wrists and arms dates back to the Holocaust, when Nazis branded Jewish and Roma people to identify them among the mass of malnourished, diseased, and starved bodies piling up throughout concentration camps such as Auschwitz. It was, first and foremost, a method of identification, but over time it became a way to dehumanize people. When someone is just a number, it becomes easier to toss them into gas chambers and ignore their wailing pleas for mercy.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>Six million European Jews were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">murdered during the Holocaust</a>. “At least five million Soviet prisoners of war, Romany, Jehovah’s Witnesses, homosexuals, and other victims” were slaughtered as well. Nine million people murdered in total, many of whom had numbers just like Rocket’s on their arms and wrists.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=740 data-injectable=true>So, no, getting Rocket’s numbers tattooed is not a good idea. There is no “reclaiming” a number as a name, or getting one in solidarity. It’s nonsensical, shameless, and unintelligent, to be frank. But most of all, it’s disrespectful to the nine million — nine million! — people who didn’t just “lose their lives,” but were murdered in cold blood for being nothing other than who they are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=113 data-current-count=113 data-injectable=false>As so aptly put by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kimberly Terasaki at The Mary Sue</a>, “You are not a number, and you shouldn’t want to be.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKerlaPAqsDIr5xmqp%2BYuKbAjKuYnJufpLtuwMCtq6ino2K2r3nWmqKeZZ%2BbeqjBwKubopmeqHqwsoytn55ll5a5osTYZq2opF1oerG%2Bzq%2BcrGWknbJuw86ro51lnpqypb%2BMpqarnV2dvK27wpqsrKxdmrG2r8CtoKimXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./greek-salad-pita-pizzas.html><span>←</span><span>Greek Salad Pita Pizzas Modern Honey</span></a>
