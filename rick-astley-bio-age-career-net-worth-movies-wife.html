His early life was marked by a passion for music. As a child, he sang in the church choir and taught himself to play the drums. After leaving school, he worked as a driver for a local film processing company, but his real passion was always music.</p><p>Read Also:&nbsp;<a href=#>Hannah Barron Bio, Age, Parents, Career, Net Worth, Husband</a></p><h2><strong>Rick Astley Career</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ghbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/You_just_got_RICKROLLED.png><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>In 1985, Astley was working as a studio assistant at PWL Studios in London when he was discovered by the producers Pete Waterman, Mike Stock, and Matt Aitken. They saw potential in the young singer and offered him a recording contract. Astley’s first single, “When You Gonna,” was released in 1986, but it failed to make much of an impact.</p><p>His big break came the following year with the release of “Never Gonna Give You Up.” The song became an instant hit, reaching number one on the charts in 25 countries. Astley’s distinctive voice, combined with the catchy pop beat, made the song a worldwide sensation, and it is still a popular meme and internet prank to this day.</p><p>The actor followed up his success with a string of hits, including “Together Forever,” “She Wants To Dance With Me,” and “Take Me To Your Heart.” His debut album, “Whenever You Need Somebody,” was released in 1987 and sold over 15 million copies worldwide.</p><p>Despite his success, he was never comfortable with the pop star lifestyle. He felt that his success was largely due to the efforts of his producers and felt uncomfortable with the image they had created for him. In 1993, he took a break from music to spend time with his family and pursue other interests.</p><p>He returned to music in 2001 with the release of his album “Keep It Turned On.” He continued to release albums and tour throughout the 2000s and 2010s, but he never achieved the same level of success as he did in the 1980s.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In recent years, Astley has become something of a cult icon, thanks in part to the popularity of “rickrolling,” the internet prank where unsuspecting people are tricked into clicking on a link that leads to the “Never Gonna Give You Up” video.</p><h2><strong>Rick Astley Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Rick Astley has an estimated net worth of about $16million approximately.
