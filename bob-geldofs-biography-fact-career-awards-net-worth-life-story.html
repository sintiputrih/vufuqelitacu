After using his fame to leverage attention and money for starving Africa, the Irishman was fated to be a good guy so it seems only fair that he’s worth a few million.</p><p>For more than 25 years, Geldof the musician was overshadowed by Geldof the poverty campaigner (for which he received an honorary knighthood). Now 59, he has released an album called How to Compose Popular Songs That Will Sell – his first in nine years – which has been well received by fans and the music press. It’s not all going his way, though. Wildchild daughter Peaches – who presents the television show OMG! on ITV2 – meanders aimlessly in and out of the gossip columns, while Ten Alps, the television production company founded by Geldof in 1999, saw its share price drift down in 2010. The company is now worth a little more than £5m, with Geldof’s stake just £250,000. A subsidiary of Ten Alps, Belfast-based Below the Radar, has launched The Detail, a news and current affairs website funded by the taxpayer and the American philanthropist Chuck Feeney. Geldof also owns a one-third stake in Castaway Productions, maker of the hugely successful Survivor reality show. As his co-shareholder, Lord Alli, said of Survivor’s success in 28 countries: “We are a royalty collection agency. [It’s] a nice position to be in.” Nice, indeed, when Castaway made profits of £3.8m on £7.6m sales in 2009-10, valuing Geldof’s stake at about £20m. He also owned a third of Planet 24 TV. Its sale in 1999 netted Geldof £6m. He invested in an internet holiday company, Deckchair.com, but that was sold for a knockdown £3.2m. With houses in Battersea and Kent and dividends from Ten Alps in the past three years, a £32m valuation is realistic according to Sunday Times Rich List.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJqfl3qoscudpp%2BrXZe2sLPRmqehsV2brqTAjJyYq52Vp3qiw8Crm6xlnprBbsPOq6uhZZyes6Z50q2mq7Ff</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alan-dale-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Alan Dale Net Worth</span></a>
