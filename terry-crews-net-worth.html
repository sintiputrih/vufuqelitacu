A. Crews was born in July 1968, in Michigan, United States. In the National Football League he was able to rise to fame as a great player and that’s how Terry started to build his net worth. During his career as a footballer Terry Crews played for the San Diego Chargers, Philadelphia Eagles, Los Angeles Rams and Washington Redskin. But after he finished his successful career as a&nbsp; football player T. A. Crews didn’t even think about stopping his active life style, and started to show some interest in show business. Terry’s net worth was already quite huge after seven years of football, but that was only the beginning. As a star in cinema Terry Crews made his debut in 2000 in the science fiction film “The 6th Day” directed by Roger Spottiswoode, in which <a href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> starred as the main character. Of course, such a successful debut could only increase Big T’s net worth, which was already huge.</p><p>After a successfull beginning and a good addition to Terry Crews’ net worth, he actually became a household name as he appeared as a TV guest in many different shows and starred in many movies himself. He played the Hackman in a movie titled “Gamer”, also performed as a boot camp instructor in “Bridesmaids”, played Agent 91 in a movie “Get Smart” and tookiparts in many other films which became extremely popular. That’s why today so many people in United States know how rich is Terry Crews is.</p><p>However, since his debut Terry has mostly appeared in successful comedy movies, such as “Soul Plane”, “Harsh Times”, “Balls of Fury”, “Terminator Salvation”, “Get Smart” and many others.</p><p>Talking about his personal life, Terry Crews nowadays lives in California with his wife Rebecca King-Crew, who is a former beauty queen. Together the couple has six chilren: one son Isaiah Crews and five girls: Tera, Naomi Burton, Azriel and Tera. Furthermore, at the age of 45 Big T is a grandfather already, but this relationship is kind of confusing: his wife Rebecca has a daughter from a previous relationship, who is married and already has a child herself.</p><p>Nowadays Terry Crews aka T-Money continues his acting career. In the year 2014 alone he performed in four movies: “The Expendables 3”, “Draft Day”, “Blended”, “Reach Me” and “The Single Moms Club”.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=40.459662853703><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Terry Crews</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$20 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$20 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 30, 1968</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Flint, Michigan, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.91&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>111&nbsp;kg</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Profession</td><td>American football player, Actor</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Western Michigan University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Rebecca King-Crews (m. 1990)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Children</td><td>Azriel Crews, Isaiah Crews, Wynfrey Crews, Naomi Burton-Crews, Tera Crews</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Parents</td><td>Terry Crews, Sr., Patricia Crews</td></tr><tr readability=13><td>Nicknames</td><td>Terry Alan Crews , Terrence Alan Crews , Squeegee Lo , Terry Crew , T-Money , Henry David Thoreau , Terry Crews, Jr. , Big T , Big Black Bird , Terry Crews Jr.</td></tr><tr readability=0.34782608695652><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/realterrycrews</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/terrycrews</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.27450980392157><td>Google+</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://plus.google.com/112799495919526501730</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.40909090909091><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/terrycrews</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0187719</a></td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Awards</td><td>Producer of the Year (1986),Hollywood Walk of Fame (1991), Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars (2007)</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Nominations</td><td>NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Comedy Series, NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series, Teen Choice Award for Choice TV: Parental Unit</td></tr><tr readability=24><td>Movies</td><td>The Expendables, White Chicks, Idiocracy, The Expendables 3, The Expendables 2, Blended, Friday After Next, The Longest Yard, Norbit, The 6th Day, Street Kings, Get Smart, The Ridiculous 6, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, Lottery Ticket, Bridesmaids, Balls of Fury, Terminator Salvation, Gamer, ...</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>TV Shows</td><td>World's Funniest, Are We There Yet?, Everybody Hates Chris, Platinum, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, Ultimate Beastmaster</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks readability=1><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Muscular physique</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>Frequently plays unintelligent or immature characters</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Robot dance</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Flexing his pectorals</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=66.792991811084><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>1</td><td>I am an official slow-roasted honey-baked ham. Ever since I was a kid, my thing is that I love attention.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>2</td><td>What I don't like when I see sports movies is that they usually turn out to be puff pieces. Basball movies are kind of ridiculous. They turn into the magic of the ball and the magic of having a a bat and the magic of walki9ng into a park. It's not that magical.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>3</td><td>What's so cool about 'Draft Day' is it shows the warts, all the problems, the fact that people are treated like commodities and that relationships are hard to keep in the NFL. Your personal relationships suffer. It's a high-profile job that's hard as hell.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>4</td><td>Don't get me wrong, most of the guys out there loved playing football, I loved playing it. But football is not the end for me.</td></tr><tr readability=3.6857142857143><td>5</td><td>I think if I had a <a href=#>Tiger Woods</a> lifestyle, I might have a problem with cameras.

In a movie, when I enter, its not a good thing. But I know where I'm at. But, you know, you don't have to call me by my character's name for months on end. Football taught me that, because you can go from being best friends to having to play that person on another team, you have to be able to turn that on and off. You need to find that middle ground.</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>8</td><td>I have written scripts, so I look at a part the way a writer would. That is, I look at it and look to see, ok what function do I play in this scene? You have to know what you bring to that scene and what you're about there. And usually, I play the heat, the drama, the heavy.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>9</td><td>A lot of ball players love the Friday movies, they're big fans. I can go now to any team and be known now more for the movies than I was ever when I was playing. A lot of the guys have retired now. But I still get calls, congratulating me and that.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>10</td><td>If you look at the parts Ive played and the movies Ive done...I mean you have to work with the stereotype. The stereotype gets you paid, it gets you in the business.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>11</td><td>I have a background in like graphic design and a little bit of website.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>12</td><td>I told them, everybody expects you to be a little adult. 'When we're on break, go and play.' These are kids. You don't have to retreat to your trailer.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>13</td><td>There's drama in everything. Thats why I love movies. Like Welcome to the Dollhouse, I'm a 350-pound black man, and I could understand what it was like to be a little white girl.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>14</td><td>I was always more of a film guy than an athlete guy. I had an art scholarship at Western. But I actually had a Chrysler scholarship to Interlochen up in Traverse City, Michigan. Then had an art scholarship to Western and I just walked onto the football team. But I'm actually a sci-fi special effects guy.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>15</td><td>You can't do sports for the rest of your life, I don't care how good you are. You can be the best ever, but it's still going to go away. But now that I'm doing what I'm doing? I'm just thankful that I feel like my best days are still ahead of me.</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>16</td><td>I never wanted to do acting or anything. But I tell you, my friend and I, his name is Derrick Carr, a guy I was playing football with on the Rams. He and I wrote a script and we put our money together and made a movie out in Detroit in the off-season. It was called Young Boys Incorporated, all about this gang that ran Detroit for a long time. The big thing about them was that they'd get young kids. Because then if the kids were picked up they'd go to juvie, when they were eighteen they'd be released and their slate would be wiped clean and they'd start all over again. So we made that movie. It was terrible. We put all our money together. I was hooked. I had just finished my first season with the Redskins. Wed get kicked out of locations. I loved it. I knew thats what I wanted to do.</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>17</td><td>Kids like Tyler come around only once in a generation. I thank God every day for this little kid being on our show because some kids have it, some kids don't. It's not about being a little adult, it's about being a kid and portraying a kid, and I think that America gets it when he does it.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>18</td><td>You have to be willing to put yourself on camera. You have to be willing to not look perfect.</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>19</td><td>A guy I knew in high school got my number from my mom, called me up and was like, I cant believe I'm talking to you. I was like, 'it's me, it's Terry, I went to high school with you! What do you mean!?'</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>20</td><td>First of all, bring your deodorant, bring your odor-blocker body wash, because there's gonna be a lot of funky men in that theater.</td></tr><tr readability=5.7729083665339><td>21</td><td>I'm still steady into <a href=#>Coldplay</a>.
