The shirt shows a woman with her hand in her underwear with the title “D.I.Y.”, which stands for “do it yourself.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Wow, there’s nothing subtle about this message at all. Is she telling Chris she can take care of business herself?</p><h3>Rihanna Was Sick Of Chris Not Putting Their Relationship First</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>It’s apparent that Rihanna is trying to get over the fact that she put in 200 percent in her relationship with Chris, and received nothing in return.&nbsp;As <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> previously reported, one of the reasons that Rihanna and Chris split was because he wasn’t putting much effort into their relationship.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“It’s frustrating for her because she has a big heart,” the source says. The relationship pretty much dissolved because Rihanna expected Chris to put more effort into making the relationship work.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“She gives and gives and loves him hard but there is only so much a girl can do,” says the insider. “She doesn’t think Chris knows that or even cares.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Now it’s your turn to sound off, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>.
