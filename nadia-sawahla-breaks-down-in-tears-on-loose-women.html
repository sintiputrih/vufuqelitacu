Currently, the drug is only permitted in Scotland. Breast Cancer Now has launched a petition, calling on NICE, NHS England, Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca to make Enhertu available to patients in the rest of the UK.&nbsp;</p><p id=eEu54t7axhN data-wc=31>Speaking to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>MailOnline</a>, Nadia said: "We want that drug available to them.

Back in March, the mum-of-one joined the panel, telling them: "I don't know how long I've got, some statistics two to four years, some say three to five, I am 3 years in and it's scary. It's not a fairy tale, it only ends one way. All we can have is extra time and this drug would have given me that, more time with my daughter. Six months might not sound like a long time, but it is in the world of secondary breast cancer."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
