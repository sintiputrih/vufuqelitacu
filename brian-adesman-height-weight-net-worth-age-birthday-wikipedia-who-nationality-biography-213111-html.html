Mr. Milan later publicly denied the incident occurred.&nbsp; In response, Brian Adesman reportedly made the following comments to the press:</p><p class=v1MsoNormal>Basically, as lawyers, we have a duty to investigate any potential case that we’re going to file in court.&nbsp; And we’re also considered officers of the court and we have an obligation to make sure that any claims we allege are supported by evidence, and that they’re not frivolous, and that they’re not untrue.</p><p class=v1MsoNormal>And so, before we draft and file any complaint in any case, we will investigate the surrounding circumstances.&nbsp; That can entail a bunch of different things, up to hiring private investigators, or interviewing witnesses, or talking with people who were around the scene at the time of the incident.</p><p class=v1MsoNormal>And [the fact that Junior Killed Queen Latifah’s dog] was something that we uncovered and definitely corroborated with lots of evidence.&nbsp; And it’s currently, it’s something that they deny, and that Cesar Millan has denied ever since the story broke.&nbsp; But I can assure you that I have seen the evidence and we feel very confident in making the claim that the incident did, in fact, happen.</p><p class=v1MsoNormal>Brian Adesman is known for being equal parts aggressive and creative in his approach to litigation and trial. &nbsp;He is also known for providing unique insight into complex legal issues as a legal correspondent.&nbsp;<span class=v1apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class=v1MsoNormal><span class=ez-toc-section id=Body_Measurements_and_Social_Media></span><b>Body Measurements and Social Media</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p class=v1MsoNormal>Brian Adesman is 5 foot 11 inches tall and weighs a healthy 77 kg.</p><p class=v1MsoNormal>Brian Adesman’s twitter handle is <a href=# rel=noopener>@BrianAdesman</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcLGrqCdnaSeuqZ6wqikaJqlqLavsdKspJqmX5e%2Fqq3NZpidnaOirq95x56goKCkYsSmtcahq2amlal6uLvRrZ9mmZeaeqO10a2fnZmpYsSqt8ipnJ2hkWLEqbuMp5itoZ%2Bjrq2107Jkm6GfnL%2BivMeyZGtpY2Z%2BcnrHraSl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alanna-zabel-bio-age-husband-adam-levine-yoga-teacher.html><span>←</span><span>Alanna Zabel Bio, Age, Husband, Adam Levine Yoga Teacher</span></a>
