But the young actress was aware of the responsibility that came with landing the lead role of Leia Forman in That ’90s Show, the adventure-seeking daughter of Eric Forman (Topher Grace) and Donna Pincioti (Laura Prepon), having grown up with older siblings who were already ardent fans of the programme.</p><p>The eagerly anticipated sequel series, which debuted on Thursday on Netflix, follows Leia and the unlikely group of friends she meets while spending the summer with her grandparents Red (Kurtwood Smith) and Kitty (Debra Jo Rupp) in the same Point Place home where her parents first fell in love. The story is set in 1995. Callie, who turns 16 next month, tells Teen Vogue over Zoom during a recent car ride, “When I was reading about her, it very much felt like I was simply reading about myself, and I loved how she was written in the pages that I got.” “My very first audition was a dialogue between Leia and Eric, and it simply seemed like a dialogue I would have with my dad,” the actor said.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Callie_Haverda_Net_Worth></span>Callie Haverda Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Callie is still too young to manage her finances legally.
