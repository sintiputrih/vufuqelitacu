For Vincent, Benedict Cumberbatch’s floundering father, husband, and puppeteer, his demons — nurtured by his childhood neglect and exacerbated by his deteriorating mental health and addiction — manifest as a 7-foot-tall, furry hallucination. His name?

She described the series as an "<strong>emotional thriller</strong>, telling <strong></strong> and other press: "It traces [Vincent's] journey as he tries to find out what's happened to his son Edgar, who disappears.

And what's key to that is he finds some drawings of Eric, which is a puppet, that Edgar has created, and he convinces himself if he can get Eric on TV, then maybe his son will come back," she continued, concluding: "So it's about this man who, through this creation, starts to understand more about himself and then goes onto a deeper and darker journey through New York."</p><p id=ePm_2fDhMBK data-wc=5><strong></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
