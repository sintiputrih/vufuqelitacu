Code Descriptors are used to describe code. 4323The procedure includes flexible transoral esophagogastroduodenoscopy for diagnostic purposes, as well as collection of specimens by brushing or washing, if necessary.</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span></span></p><h3><span>There were 18 related questions and answers found.</span></h3><p><span></span></p><h3><span>What exactly is an EDG?</span></h3><p><span>An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is a procedure in which your doctor examines the lining of your oesophagus, stomach, and duodenum via a scope. The oesophagus is a muscular tube that links your neck to your stomach and the duodenum, which is the top section of your small intestine. It is responsible for digestion. An endoscope is a tiny camera that is attached to a tube.</span></p><p><span></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><span>Is an EGD regarded to be surgical procedure?</span></h3><p><span>In an endoscopic procedure, your doctor may check the oesophagus, stomach, and duodenum, among other organs in your body (part of your small intestine). EGD is an outpatient operation, which means you will be able to return home the same day.</span></p><p><span></span></p><h3><span>Is it possible to charge CPT codes 43239 and 43259 at the same time?</span></h3><p><span>When billing both, the codes 43259 (EUS) and 43239 (stomach lesions) spring to mind as possible codes. According to NCCI modifications, there is no problem with CPT code 43252 being bundled with CPT codes 43239, 43250, 43251, 43270, and 4325In the event that an OE operation is conducted, it is documented as a separate and different process from the endoscopic treatment that was carried out.</span></p><p><span></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><span>Is it possible to charge CPT codes 43239 and 43251 together?</span></h3><p><span>Despite the fact that a modifier is permitted, you are unable to charge these treatments together since they are performed on the same location.</span></p><p><span></span></p><h3><span>What is an EGD with dilatation and how does it work?</span></h3><p><span>It is possible to broaden the section of your oesophagus that is excessively small with the use of esophageal dilatation. Prior to or during the dilatation process, an endoscopic examination of the oesophagus and stomach (EGD) may be carried out. This is accomplished by the use of an endoscope, which is a flexible tube with a light and camera attached to one end.</span></p><p><span></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><span>In what ways do CPT codes 43235 and 43239 vary from one another?</span></h3><p><span>A single diagnostic EGD code (43235 Diagnostic EGD) is chargeable in the absence of a biopsy and if the only operation done is an Esophageal Dilation conducted using the scope device alone.

The number 45378, for example, is used to describe a colonoscopy in which no polyps are discovered, while the codes 45380-45385 are used to describe a colonoscopy in which an intervention is performed (e.g., 45385 is the code for colonoscopy with polypectomy.)</span></p><p><span></span></p><h3><span>What is the meaning of CPT code 45378?</span></h3><p><span>The CPT code 45378 is the starting point for a colonoscopy that does not include a biopsy or any additional treatment.
