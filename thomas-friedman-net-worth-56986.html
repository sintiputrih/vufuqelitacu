<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Thomas Friedman Net Worth</h1></header><section class=post-content><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.idolnetworth.com/medias/profile/15/thomas-friedman.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>In September 2009, Friedman wrote an article praising China's one-party autocracy, saying that it was "led by a reasonably enlightened group of people" and that China's <a href=#>Leaders</a> are "boosting gasoline prices" and "overtaking us in electric cars, solar power, <a href=#>Energy</a> efficiency, batteries, nuclear power and wind power.". The article was in turn subject to critical analysis: Matt Lewis who wrote, "Friedman's apparent wish for a 'benign' dictator is utopian, inasmuch as it ignores Lord Acton's warning that 'absolute power corrupts absolutely.'" and <a href=#>william</a> Easterly who quotes Friedman's one-party autocracy assertions as part of his academic paper in which he concluded that, "Formal theory and evidence provides little or no basis on which to believe the benevolent autocrat story" and that, "economists should retain their traditional skepticism for stories that have little good theory or empirics to support them." However, in a July 2012 article in the NYT, he also wrote that the current <a href=#>Chinese</a> leadership has not used its surging economic growth to also introduce gradual political reform and that, "Corruption is as bad as ever, institutionalized transparency and rule of law remain weak and consensual politics nonexistent." When asked if he had "China envy" during a Fresh Dialogues interview, Friedman replied, "You detect the envy of someone who wants his own government to act democratically with the same effectiveness that China can do autocratically." Likewise, in a 2011 interview with the BBC Friedman says that he wants his children to live in a world where "there's a strong America counterbalancing a strong and thriving China, and not one where you have a strong and rising China and an America that is uncertain, weak and unable to project power economically and militarily it historically did."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeknbyurdJmnauhlZm6orqMp5ytZaekv7W0jG5tcnBm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./firefly-lane-the-real-reason-why-netflix-show-wont-return-for-season-three.html><span>←</span><span>The real reason why Firefly Lane on Netflix is ending</span></a>
