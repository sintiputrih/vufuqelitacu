We already know that legacy stars from Fox’s X-Men universe will appear in Deadpool 3, so it didn’t take much to get folks convinced that at least one former X-icon could cameo opposite Brie Larson and company in the new movie.</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false>Specifically, thanks to a shot of a Black woman in a white superhero costume striding past Teyonah Parris’ Monica Rambeau, with a blanket falling off their shoulders looking like a cape, everyone started to wonder: is Storm in The Marvels? Well, wonder no more as here is your answer.</p><h2 id=h-does-halle-berry-cameo-as-storm-in-the-marvels data-injectable=false>Does Halle Berry cameo as Storm in The Marvels?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/The-Marvels-Storm-Halle-Berry.jpg><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=274 data-injectable=false><strong>No, Storm does not appear in The Marvels. </strong>However, fans were right to suspect that the woman in the white super-suit was someone of significance as they are indeed a character we already know well from the MCU’s past. Well, to be more specific, a new variant of them.</p><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=690 data-injectable=true>As was another common, more plausible, theory, the white-suited woman is Binary, the Captain Marvel variant from the comics, who is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed to be another version of Maria Rambeau</a>, Monica’s mother, from another reality. Lashana Lynch reprises her role, following on from her appearances as Earth-616’s Maria in Captain Marvel and the Earth-838 incarnation in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>As for where this Maria hails from, it’s confirmed to be… Fox’s X-Men universe! Yes, we do get an X-Men cameo, just not in the form of Halle Berry but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one of her X-Men: The Last Stand co-stars</a>. And it’s sure to be one that won’t leave any old-school Fox fans feeling blue.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom6ido2LBqa3TZq9mpZWjeqqvzqdkq52Robm6ecearZ5lkWKwornEqGSipl2ptaZ5zJqpr52cqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-cant-you-throw-ashes-in-the-ocean.html><span>←</span><span>Why can't you throw ashes in the ocean?</span></a>
